Bequeath to the son-in-law of the gunsmith as an offering on the day of his only daughter&#39;s wedding. Her name was Daisy Boru. She was beautiful, young, and in love with the son of a powerful governor.</p>\n<p>Boru lived on a warm tropical planet in the boundary zone bordering the Drenthe Republic. During this time, the Athylian empire was rapidly expanding. A new queen hungered for her empire. Early in her reign, she moved to capture much of The Scoret Coast. Her Royal Navy established several small outposts, including the tropical planet, Port Baysia.</p>\n\n<p>The outpost sat at the galactic rimward edge of imperial territory. It was the tip of the royal navy&#39;s spear. As the Queen&#39;s forces stabbed through the void, she established this as a terminus for every major trade route through the Drenthe. Baysia&#39;s harbor berthed ships fat with scoret, salt, and spices filled with goods from the faraway republic. These ships hung like plump Napier cherries from a branch, ripe for the picking by pirates and alike. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond the walls of the port and the harbor, the city hosted a diverse range of creatures. It was a cultural melting pot. Its location in the galactic rim, and being an Athylian trading port near the free republic of Drenthe destined its fate. The Royal Navy, Republic citizens, and other less than savory characters were known to frequent the harbor. The Queen exercised tight control, where she could. The diverse city was generally peaceful. It was the nearby space that caused the most strife in the region.</p>\n\n<p>In the residential district of the city lived the master gunsmith. A man named Bernardes Boru. He wore a wiry salt and pepper beard and was often seen in an old leather smith&#39;s apron over a pair of suspenders and tiny round glasses. During his youth, he held an apprenticeship under one of the galaxy&#39;s oldest royal armorers, the legendary Orden-Praxis Solares. Early on, Bernardes became a prodigy. His unparalleled craftsmanship quickly caught the eye of the imperial armorers. Boru devoted his life to his craft, imbuing his elements of war with a quality matched by only the finest gunmakers.</p>\n\n<p>His final piece took an entire lya to finish. The gunsmith poured his heart into every minute detail. Once completed, the pistol was nothing short of a masterpiece. Its delicate details sang homage to the kill-or-be-killed culture of empire, and it&#39;s fit, and finish was top-notch. Boru used only the finest materials, sourced from some of the most distant points in the galaxy. It was well suited for the family of a royal governor. Well suited for the family that was to accept his own in marriage.</p>\n\n<p>It was a long time ago, but Bernades Boru could still clearly remember the day she was born. She was the oldest of three offspring. She grew into a strong-willed and beautiful young woman. From the day she was born, Daisy was the passion of her father&#39;s life. He showered her with love, and affection. She was the pride of his life. He was only a gunsmith, but he loved to see her smile the most. He was determined to give her the one thing he never had the pleasure of having. Not only that, but he wanted to give her a perfect wedding with the perfect man, a man who would love her with the innocent love that he never had.</p>\n\n<p>The master craftsman inlaid the oversized grip with dark and rich Takaran wildwood, while the crimson stain turned the grip into storming clouds of mahogany. Its steeply angled frame, round cylinder, and long barrel were hand-polished to a perfect mirror finish. Once assembled, it was hand-etched with an intricate macabre design. In the fresco, a pack of undead four-legged animals hunts their prey. Blood drips from their exposed teeth. Their bodies are worn and mangy. Bones lay strewn about their path as the pack of beasts enters a thick jungle. The design surrounds a phrase written in an old-style Athylian script, hand-lettered by the gunsmith.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the wolf that shall break it must die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was a morbid beauty to the weapon&#39;s grim design. Some believed it to be cursed. Others saw deep symbolism of animal instinct, frailty, and reason to believe in the law of the jungle. Kill or be killed. Upon seeing it for the first time, the governor was elated. He thought it to be a true masterwork.</p>\n\n<p>The weapon was completed only a matter of cycles before the wedding. The piece laid in a gilded case, lined with elegant red satin and delivered by Buro himself to the governing family. The delivery was early, but all for the ceremony to be held at the royal governor&#39;s estate in three short cycles. After it left Buro&#39;s hands, the weapon was thought to be secure. It sat quiet, locked away in the house&#39;s safe room, piled with other gifts of matrimony.</p>\n\n<p>It was early summer in the port city of Baysia as the wedding of the governor&#39;s son drew near. The bustling port drank and fought and gambled and boomed and busted at the center of the single most valuable trade route in the galaxy. A trade route at the edge of a rapidly expanding empire. It stood at the precipitous of lawlessness. In the space between the free republic, and the Athylian empire, piracy took hold – and it did not let go.</p>\n\n<p>Interstellar travel in these times was far more dangerous than today. Making matters worse, pirates lurked beyond the narrow defense zone of Baysia. Their hunting ground: the Victoria Reef. A massive debris field, enveloped in a thick primordial haze, sat beyond the reach of the planet. The reef was littered with ships that had run around after smashing into chunks of ice and rock hidden in the fog. For those headed to the Drenthe Republic, traveling through the reef was the fastest and least expensive route. Going around added days, if not weeks to a merchant&#39;s journey.</p>\n\n<p>Those who were going to the Free Republic, though, often opted to go by way of the planet Lare. It was a longer journey, but the rock and ice was not a problem for the planet&#39;s starport. The long trip through the asteroid field was said to be beautiful and full of intrigue, fables of pirates, and hidden treasures. The passage was known by many as a great test of the soul.</p>\n\n<p>Traders and captains would tell the story of the pirate ship <em>Leviathan</em> how she would stalk her prey in the dark and dangerous Victoria Reef — laying in wait for unescorted merchant vessels to steam into striking distance. Running dark and rigged for stealth – she&#39;d attack without warning. Her Captain, a merciless man named Hyde, was careful not to destroy his target. He was a cunning pirate, never risking lost treasure. The crew of <em>Leviathan</em> understood their first goal was to disable their quarry. Ignoring the significant risk of life, they&#39;d board the vessel to plunder the cargo. They would capture or kill the crew, and either scuttle or steal whatever remained.</p>\n\n<p>The crew of the pirate ship was not unlike many vessels of the era. They lead a life of uncertainty. Sickness, death, and constant desertion plagued the pirate ships. They always needed to recruit new crew members. </p>\n\n<p>Hyde was an especially adept showman. Recruiting meant living an illusion of wealth and fame. He would dress in beautiful clothes, and make brazen appearances at the ports taverns and inns. Drunken mariners listened to lavish stories of untold wealth abound in the galaxy. Young and old, creature or not, all would join. Many would perish at the wretched leadership of Captain Hyde.</p>\n\n<p>Hyde&#39;s audacity developed from the Queen of Athylia being too busy expanding to pay much attention to privacy. Once the archipelago of Scoret Coast outposts had been established, she shifted her eye to the coreward regions. As she sought to grow her fledgling colonies, <em>Leviathan</em> and her crew were left unchecked and unchallenged in the galactic north. This sense of invulnerability would soon end, as their most daring adventure unfolded.</p>\n\n<p>On the morning of 1709 Mandragoras, 21, <em>Leviathan</em>, entered the atmosphere of Baysia, hidden and without authorization. Under the command of the pirate Captain Hyde, her crew raided the royal city. <em>Leviathan&#39;s</em> main guns fired salvos at the port, creating confusion, destroying two residences and setting fire to a warehouse and surrounding buildings. At three hours past midnight, royal guards reported a breach at the gates of the governor&#39;s house. The city&#39;s general alarm sounded, more fires broke out. Hyde thrived on the chaos and led his men on a quest for riches and flames.</p>\n\n<p>Awoken by the sound of <em>Leviathan&#39;s</em> powerful 9-inch guns, the bride Daisy Boru thought of one thing. Her husband to be, a slender young man named Whalen. She knew the governor&#39;s residence would be safe. It was one of the most well-protected buildings in the city. She left her father, the master gunsmith, and began the search for Whalen. Daisy donned a night cloak and slipped through the door of her father&#39;s home. She ventured west, racing away from the harbor and into the hilled city.</p>\n\n<p>It was bedlam on the streets of Port Baysia. Daisy met sirens, fires and screaming masses. Looters took to the shops and storerooms, smashing windows and doors. She fought through the chaos. Determined, she pushed toward the governor&#39;s residence sitting atop a small hill west of the city center. Fighting the crowds, she passed into the Lafayette neighborhood, a once vibrant immigrant district. The area was known for its public plaza, the Royal Commons. Daisy remembered this is where her Whalen would picnic and shop the local markets. A place where their love had grown. In the light of the flaming homes, Daisy witnessed the plaza had been all but destroyed. The impact of a shell had demolished the square. Homes had crumbled, bricks and timber were strewn about and the trees had been charred, scorched by the flames of terror.</p>\n\n<p>She arrived at the whitewashed stone mansion of the governor. The sound of yelling and gunfire echoed from open windows on the upper floors. The pirates had found the residence and had gotten there before her. Across the lawn, and through the smashed and torn wooden doors of the ground floor, she quietly snuck inside. There, the bodies of two royal guards lay slain on the cold marble. She held back her shock and pressed on; her mind couldn&#39;t believe what was taking place. It was all happening so fast.</p>\n\n<p>In her haste, she arrived at the residence unarmed. This wouldn&#39;t usually be a problem, being the daughter of a gunsmith. Thinking of her father, she remembered he had delivered the ceremonial weapon, not two cycles prior. Being familiar with the building, she hurried to the safe room where it would have been stored. There she confronted a pile of boxes – wedding presents. Yelling and more shots emanated from upper floors as she tore through the gilded paper boxes. Tossing thoughtful garments, gifts, royal banknotes, and scarlet red wrapping paper aside, she made her way to a dark wooden box.</p>\n\n<p>Daisy took the container from the shelf and found the gleaming weapon inside. She had not noticed the fine detail work of the morass scene etched on its side. Had she seen it, she would have admired it. Although grim, the scene was a depiction of the deep cultural values of the Athylian people.</p>\n\n<p>The Athylians embraced an attitude of survival of the fittest. This attitude stemmed from a collective struggle. As a people, they survived the potential annihilation of their homeworld. They came together to escape the clutches of gravity, freeing them from the bounds of their globe. They avoided the collision of the moon they lived on with the planet it orbited, and because of this, they saw themselves superior. They were fit to conquer the galaxy, almost as if they had passed some test proctored by the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Once armed, Daisy sprang out of the safe room, crushing a pile of torn gift boxes on the way. Once on solid ground, she thought to check the weapon. Pressing the release, the cylinder opened with a click. The curved chamber revealed seven brass cartridges loaded in <em>Reason to Believe</em>. Oddly, her father had delivered the weapon loaded. It seemed unlike him. Curious, she lifted one brass bolt partially out of its chamber and examined the delicate embellishment. Each round had a unique design engraved on its casing, representing one of the seven original colonies of Athylia. Another reminder of his attention to detail, and his love for the greatest empire the galaxy had ever known.</p>\n\n<p>With no time to admire her father&#39;s work, she hurried toward the commotion above. She ran, pistol in hand, up the broad flight of stairs, and across the wraparound mezzanine. Through the open wooden doors to the dining hall, she found her fiancé. He was at gunpoint. The pirates had been forcing him to open locked doors and to locate family safes. They were searching for something and destroying the mansion room by room to find it. While out of sight, she watched as three tattered pirates pointed their weapons and demanded haste. From across the mezzanine, she could smell smoke. The build was on fire. Time was running out. She had to act before the pirates burned the building to the ground.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am but a servant. I do not have the keys – p-please.&quot; Whalen stuttered his plea, while significantly undervaluing himself. Had the pirates discovered his true identity, he would have been worth far more. Ransom, for the son of an imperial governor, would be a small fortune.</p>\n\n<p>From her hidden position around the corner, Daisy stepped into the dining hall, revealing herself. Two men clamored over Whalen as he nervously fiddled with the lock of a strongbox. The group detected her, and everyone froze for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>Whalen looked up at Daisy in disbelief. In desperation, he pleaded with his eyes, trying to convince her to leave him and to find a way out of the burning hell. His pleading eyes were not what she had expected. She had seen his light, in the Royal Commons. She had seen his heart. Now, she saw terror.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Daisy! You shouldn&#39;t be here!&quot; he shouted. The thieves immediately ran toward her, intent on taking her alive. Before they could lay a finger on her, she raised her gleaming weapon. Drawing down on them, they stopped, dead in their tracks. <em>Reason to Believe</em> shook in her right hand. Its barrel bounced and shimmered in the light.</p>\n\n<p>Daisy was a prodigy of gunplay. It came naturally to her. While other girls practiced handwork, she practiced her aim. &quot;Have care, Pirate. I will not hesitate to unload this in your craw.&quot; She kept her aim steady. Daisy didn&#39;t know where her confidence came from. It was suddenly overwhelming. Her heart pounded as she stood before the pirate captain. His beard was matted and filthy. The rest of him was equally disheveled. He had a pistol of his own, but she didn&#39;t wait to find out what he was going to do with it.</p>\n\n<p>The eldest of the three pirates turned to her. He spoke slowly in a deep, grisly voice. &quot;What is it... exactly that ye want here, katra?&quot;. He used the far-core word for &quot;girl&quot;, giving away his origins. She knew it was Captain Hyde. His demeanor, his voice, his clothes, it was unmistakable to her. She could smell him. Hyde looked at the weapon in Daisy&#39;s hand, and a scowl crept over his face.</p>\n\n<p>The eldest of the three pirates turned to her, his voice a deep, grisly growl that seemed to reverberate through the very air. &quot;What is it that you want here, katra?&quot; he spat, using the far-core word for &quot;girl&quot; and revealing his origins as a denizen of the outer reaches of the realm. She could sense the power emanating from him, feel the weight of his presence as he towered over her.</p>\n\n<p>She saw the tall, imposing figure and the unmistakable glint of gold chains around his neck. He had a ragged black tricorn hat perched atop his head, and a long coat of stained burgundy velvet draped across his shoulders. His leather boots thumped heavily against the deck and the stench of rum and tobacco wafted through the air. His gravelly voice filled her ears as he bellowed orders, and she knew without a doubt that standing before her was Captain Hyde, the infamous pirate lord.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Did ye come here to die, girl?&quot; he sneered, his voice dripping with contempt. &quot;Or just watch the fire?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She&#39;s here for him, Captain!&quot; cried a scrawny, tanned pirate, pulling Daisy&#39;s fiancé closer to him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; the bearded leader hissed, fixing the offender with a glare. &quot;We&#39;ll let her speak.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Daisy held his gaze, her voice low, her hands steady. &quot;I am here for the one in your hand, Pirate. Let him go.&quot; She raised her gun and trained it on him a gleaming pistol with a polished wooden handle, a lengthy shining barrel. A spark of longing flashed in the Captain&#39;s eyes as he stared at the weapon, as if part of him wanted to possess it. His lust battled with his malice, creating a cocktail of ill intent.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t shoot her!&quot; Whalen pleaded with the pirates, but was in no position to help her. He could do little more than watch, and gasp for air after another powerful blow from the pirates.</p>\n\n<p>The Captain studied the woman at the doorway, trying to discern the origins of her weapon but coming up empty. Finally, he leaned towards her, a crooked, yellow smile spreading across his face.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well then, I&#39;ll make a deal with you, filly. You can have him if you give me your weapon. What do you say? A fair trade, aye? We were about finished with him!&quot; He laughed, a guttural sound that was echoed by his toothless crew.</p>\n\n<p>The walls of the atrium began to groan and creak, smoke filling the air as the sound of fire grew louder. The building was coming apart at the seams. Flames shot through the floor, through the ceiling and began to spread across the walls. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What say you? Do we have a deal?&quot; the Captain pressed, his eyes fixed on Daisy&#39;s weapon.</p>\n\n<p>Daisy knew there was only one choice: To give up her one and only weapon, or to watch her beloved burn. The girl he loved, who just minutes earlier had been filled with life and purpose, was reduced to a single thought: &#39;How can I save him?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>She hesitated, looking at the pirates and Whalen, then released the hammer and lowered her weapon. The Captain snatched it from her hand, breathing in the scent of her hair before retreating to a safe distance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Good choice, filly,&quot; he whispered, his voice like gravel.</p>\n\n<p>He signaled to the pirate holding Whalen, who threw him to the ground. Daisy rushed to his side, but it was too late. The Captain had already pulled the trigger of her weapon, the small curved barrels spun as the hammer dropped. A puff of smoke spewed from the breach, and Whalen&#39;s body jerked as the ball struck him in the chest.</p>\n\n<p>He cried out in pain as he fell to the floor, his cries lost in the sound of the wooden beams exploding in the inferno.</p>\n\n<p>Daisy screamed, falling to the ground in despair. She was helpless, bleeding and unraveling as the fire ravaged the building around her. Smoke filled her lungs and tears stained her face. She was no longer fighting for a doomed city, she was fighting for her life, as the building began to collapse around her.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; she cried, her voice pleading. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; She pounded the ground helplessly as the flames danced around her. Smoke filled her lungs as she fled the atrium, running for her life.</p>\n\n<p>When she reached the charred grass of the west lawn, she looked back at the entrance, watching in horror as the flaming building finally collapsed, the structure giving way to the fire&#39;s fury. She collapsed to her knees, weeping as her husband lay dead inside the inferno.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment the sound of the fire became deafening, a swirling vortex of flames and smoke. At the sound of shattering glass, she looked up to see the second story windows. Ash fell from the burning trees and the smoke rose to the sky. The flames grew and destroyed all traces of life, until finally, twilight was upon the city.</p>\n\n<p>She was paralyzed by her grief, until a thunderous rumbling startled her like low-pitched rolling drums. Daisy looked up and saw the dark silhouette of an imperial fleet descending from the heavens. The orange-purple sky illuminated their fiery re-entry, and the bright red strike flares released from their hulls created a mesmerizing spectacle. Daisy felt a chill as she watched the immense battleship, flanked by two destroyers, plummet toward the city. The glare of the morning sun off their hulls made them appear almost invincible, and Daisy knew that the Athyian armada had certainly arrived.</p>\n\n<p>The mighty vessels plunged into the bay, sending a shock wave of white water out across the sea. A thick mist of hot vapor rolled up from their churning engines as the rising sun blazed off their steel hulls. Daisy then noticed the smaller and darker colored <em>Leviathan</em> lift off from the heart of the city. Like a bat ascending into the sky, it soon disappeared into the clouds. Following it closely were two smaller pirate frigates. They headed out of the atmosphere and into the fading twilight. Their engines burned a brilliant blue, ready to give chase.</p>\n\n<p>The pirate fleet, including the flagship <em>Leviathan</em>, exited the atmosphere and burned all ahead towards Victoria Reef. However, the armada was ready for their escape. In addition to the ships that de-orbited, the Queen&#39;s admiral had dispatched two commonwealth-class orbital patrol cruisers, <em>Larkspur</em> and <em>Duchess of Cumberland</em> to intercept and destroy the fleeing pirate fleet. Imperial ships held the speed advantage. They were fast and new, built out of a modern colonial starport on Cevos Prime. Hyde and his crew had older, slower ships, but they knew their old hunting grounds better than anyone else. They had the territorial advantage.</p>\n\n<p>The two Commonwealth vessels were small, just over two hundred meters in length. But they were not to be taken lightly. Each one was armed with two large kinetic cannons, and equipped with over half a dozen medium caliber railguns. They were intended to patrol and secure the frontier sectors of the Scoret Coast, but had been redeployed to the fight at Victoria Reef. Their layered armor was a good match for the pirate frigates, and the Commonwealth frigates boasted some of the most advanced sensors available. Hyde and his crew were going to have to use their wits and guile to survive. They could not expect to take on the Queen&#39;s navy and win.</p>\n\n<p>The pirates knew their ships would never outrun the faster, more modern Commonwealth vessels. So Hyde had decided that they would try to outmaneuver them instead. He knew the area well and had some experience dodging the patrol cruisers. It was something he and his crew had done more than once. They called Victoria Reef <em>The Maze</em> for a reason. There were a countless uncharted asteroids and thousands of ship-killing rocks scattered throughout the sector. Pirates did not own the territory, but they certainly knew it well enough to breathe life into the legend.</p>\n\n<p>A feverish chase commenced. The Commonwealth cruisers were fast, sleek ships, and quickly gained on the smaller, older pirate ship. They were able to keep up with <em>Leviathan</em> and <em>Elena</em> quite well without much trouble, thanks to their exceptional speed. But Hyde had plotted his course well and intended to lose them amongst the many asteroids.</p>\n\n<p>Following closely, the two cruisers tracked the pirate ships into the reef. <em>Duchess</em> fired first. She brought up her forward guns and began firing at one of the smaller vessels. It veered off, breaking away from <em>Leviathan</em> and Captain Hyde. For a moment, the reef worked in favor of the pirate vessel. Several shells narrowly missed its hull while dodging chunks of ice and rock.</p>\n\n<p>The chase progressed deeper into the reef. The fog thickened, and the obstacles grew larger and more dangerous. The evading pirate ship slowed to avoid a massive drifting glacier, and that&#39;s when <em>Duchess</em> struck. The cruiser lunged forward, firing her kinetic cannons in rapid succession.</p>\n\n<p>The pirate ship was far too slow to get out of the way, and the cannon shells struck the vessel with startling accuracy. Shells ripped through the magazine compartment of the pirate&#39;s hull. Ammunition and fuel from the power core caught fire, burning for a moment until exploding in a massive fireball that tore through the ship. As she broke up, the burning remains were consumed by the elements surrounding it and collapsed though the ice falling to the planet below like a fiery star.</p>\n\n<p><em>Duchess of Cumberland</em> slowed to search the scorched glacier for survivors; all were lost.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Larkspur</em> trailed the two remaining pirate two vessels, including Hyde&#39;s. For three long cycles, the ships stalked each other in the debris and fog. All the while the imperial fleet floated at the edge of the reef, waiting for a message from <em>Larkspur</em>. On the morning of the fourth cycle, naval protocol forced the Captain of <em>Larkspur</em> to break the engagement. Procedure mandated that <em>Larkspur</em> come to the reef&#39;s surface and make contact the local fleet. Breaking away from the chase, she began her ascent. By mid-cycle, she was clear of the fog and transmitted an encrypted message.</p>\n\n<p>It read: &quot;Battlegroup. Follow me. I&#39;ve found them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This would be the last message sent by <em>Larkspur.</em> Discovered many lya later pillaged, burned out and gutted. The pirates got the best of her. The Captain&#39;s logs reported she tracked <em>Leviathan</em> deep into the uncharted territory of the reef. There, she managed to destroy the remaining pirate escort vessel, and engage with Captain Hyde&#39;s flagship in close range gunfighting. The damaged and leaking atmosphere,<em>Larkspur</em> was boarded, scuttled, and left to rot in the reef.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Leviathan</em> then escaped into the wilds of the reef. After the battle, Hyde found he and his crew considerably off course. With the Imperial fleet in the system, he was unable to exit the murky reef to sight stars for celestial navigation. He was lost and blind. Hyde and his crew wandered. Cycles passed, and mutiny brewed. Losing two ships of his fleet, and taking fire from an Imperial cruiser led his crew to question his authority. Eventually, they revolted. Divided and angry, the fractionated sailors ruthlessly attacked one another, vying for power and control. The chaos aboard the ship led her to run aground.</p>\n\n<p>The final fate of many of those pirates may never be known. However, as <em>Leviathan</em> met her end, two of her six escape boats jettisoned. They made their way to clear space, only to be captured by imperial forces. Hyde was not among the survivors. It&#39;s presumed the Captain went down with his ship.</p>\n\n<p>The Queen&#39;s Navy searched the reef for months, through the fog and debris. They never found Hyde, the floating pirate outpost he left, or any of his crew. Not even a scrap of evidence remained. After decades of searching, the Imperials declared the case closed.</p>\n\n<p>The lifeless husk of <em>Leviathan</em> sat lost in the eternal void for over a hundred lya. The galaxy saw many changes while the once invincible pirate ship decayed in the icy nebula. Time passed. Cycles turned to seasons. Seasons to lya. The golden era of imperial expansion eventually ended with the Queen&#39;s untimely death. Many blamed Drenthe agents, although an assassin was never named, nor was the republic officially accused. Peace with the Drenthe ended shortly after. A show of power by the newly ordained high King went too far. He was young and inexperienced. Angered by the death of his mother, he burned many political bridges. With few allies, the long war with the Drenthe drained the mighty empire. The war cost both sides millions of lives and put the empire deep into debt.</p>\n\n<p>The economy struggled leading to an extended recession. Many worlds were abandoned by a failing government. Some broke from the empire forming independent worlds. Many of the imperial fleets were officially decommissioned. The once mighty navy was reduced to a fourth of its size. Some of the decommissioned ships became bait for independent crews in search of a new life, a new crew, and a new adventure.</p>\n\n<p>For many lya, the old pirate ship stayed untouched. However, the universe eventually came knocking.</p>\n\n<h1>2</h1>\n\n<p>Three lya ago the Cerulean Belt was well into the reign of the former king and newly self-appointed Emperor Cuperus. After leaving Ogma, I found myself working for a foul-smelling creature named Greem. A miserly old thing from the swamps of Malus VI, he ran a scrap operation out of the Victoria Reef, and I was the new blood. Young and untrained, I was handed an assignment as a cruiser for one of his rag-tag breaker crews. Combing the reef for weeks at a time, we&#39;d salvage whatever we could.</p>\n\n<p>Greem operated a small fleet of long since obsolete stellar-survey ships. The beat-up old Henry-class rigs needed constant maintenance, punished from years of use amid the rocks and ice of the reef. However, many prized them for a feature that was impossible to come by on newer, postwar vessels. The tiny ships were able to detect the radiological traces of a reactor through the dense fog. So sensitive, they could trace cold reactors from ships hundreds of lya old. These whispers of ghost ships were found throughout what we called the &quot;Graveyard.&quot; The Empire had a different name for it. Officially it designated as the &quot;Victoria Reef Mineral Territory,&quot; meaning the crown levied taxes on whatever Greem claimed we brought in. According to the Empire, he hardly ever found anything.</p>\n\n<p>There was a rumor, passed along from a scrap dealer who heard it from the skipper of a sludge hauler, that a crew found the husk of an old raider. In it was, supposedly, a vault room. Secured with a code nobody could crack, and a door nobody could open. Everybody wanted to know what was in it. Greem was no exception.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You know anything about safe cracking?&quot; Greem asked me one day. Being the first word he&#39;d spoken to me since I&#39;d been hired, I sat up quietly in my chair and shook my head. &quot;Nobody knows a damn thing about cracking a safe. I thought maybe you&#39;d know something about it, all that reading on the job. Ok then. You&#39;re going to learn and tell me how you crack into a safe.&quot; It was later I learned he liked to follow up a question with an order.</p>\n\n<p>Being the newest of the crew meant my stellar-survey ship was the oldest of the bunch. <em>Havre de Grace</em> was nine meters long, with a cramped and dilapidated crew module in the aft and the forward survey module in the stern. Separating the two modules was a narrow tunnel, it was the best place to sleep, and the only place to lay down. Most of her systems were spotty at best, including gravity generators. For some reason, they seemed to only work in the crew section. While cruising the scrap fields, I spent many nights sleeping with my head poking into the crew module, and my feet floating free in the tubular, gravity-less passage.</p>\n\n<p>She was a beat-up ship, but she had character. She was born in the midst of a war, and spent much of early life as a reconnaissance craft. The history of her life was written in the scorch marks on the outside of her hull, and the intricate web of welded patches and scars on her skin. The rest of the crew didn&#39;t like her, but I did.</p>\n\n<p>Each shift, the crews would leave Baysia in the early morning. With us would be enough supplies to work the reef for three maybe four cycles. Once in the graveyard, the survey ships would scout ahead. We&#39;d have a full cycle lead ahead of the slower, bulk breakers. When a cruiser found a strong enough signal we&#39;d lay a marker beacon, activate it, and move on. This was my life, in a cloud of colorless fog. Following the invisible traces of old reactors, while living inside of a prewar tin can that didn&#39;t care if I lived or died.</p>\n\n<p>It was about halfway through my third cycle that I made my first find. It was a Beta-lance a small corvette built for the ages. Decommissioned long before I was born, the vessel&#39;s signature was strong. Disturbingly so. As a cruiser, I couldn&#39;t board it myself, even if the readings were good, so I dutifully activated my marker beacon before moving on to the next set of coordinates. Less than a standard cycle later, I received a response from one of the scrap crews. They were coming to check my find.</p>\n\n<p>I was elated. I was naive.</p>\n\n<p>The scrap crew made short work of the vessel. They skillfully cut it open like an overripe cacti. Pulling the plates apart and dragging out the high value materials. The crew section was first, then the communication and navigation arrays. Corrosion had consumed the hull but the crew had no qualms. They tore through the carefully sealed bulkheads, the twisted and oddly shaped corridors. When the dust settled and the scrap crew removed the last piece of equipment, all that was left was a bare metal husk.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Worthless.&quot; Came over the radio from the crew. &quot;Not even worth the trip.&quot; The voice crackled over the static.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What?&quot; I thought to myself. They must not have known I was on the frequency.</p>\n\n<p>A second voice came over the airwaves, &quot;Yeah, nothing.&quot; The voice was quiet and guttural.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; Agreed the first. &quot;Someone outta get fired for this one.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when another crew member chirped in. &quot;Hey. Hey. C&#39;mon, it&#39;s not her fault. She&#39;s new, give&#39;r a break.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Her?&quot; There was a pause, then a sigh. &quot;Hows the fuel levels?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Low. Depleted already.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s a tether ahead, Banton Cay. I&#39;ll call in.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s a terminal?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We should be able to –&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I turned off the comm. Tears welled in my eyes, and I shook my head. &quot;It&#39;s not her fault,&quot; I mumbled to myself. &quot;Well who&#39;s fault is it!?&quot;. I burst into tears.</p>\n\n<p>The taste of tears reminded me of every punch from the cruelest children on Tau Ogma. The hardships my mother endured as a single parent. I remembered every time as a child I feared someone was going to die in the mines. I remembered how empty my mother&#39;s eyes seemed after my father left. I thought of every beating I took. They all brought me to here. I felt insignificant, angry, and miserable. So I cried.</p>\n\n<p>As I sat, something changed inside of me. A calm washed over me. An understanding, like nothing I&#39;d ever felt before. I thought about the creatures who pulled their own heart out of their chest. I thought about the people who threw themselves out of airlocks. Maybe it was the smell of stale air warmed by the sole light on my ship. Maybe it was the sounds of my ship&#39;s engines, humming each time it adjusted its position. Maybe it was the sound of my breathing.</p>\n\n<p>I felt something I hardly ever felt. I felt justified. I looked forward to the next find. I wanted to find something, anything, that would give me an excuse to tear it apart. I wanted a safe. I wanted a vault. I wanted a reason to destroy another ship. The gears were now turning and I found myself with an irresistible urge to destroy. I was no longer cold and wounded. I was boiling with determination.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I was determined to make a name for myself. I made it out of the Helion mines, and I had the chance now for a good life. Maybe make some coin along the way. While working under Greem, that meant making good salvage finds. It meant your crew was hauling the best scrap because of you. So, on my next rotation, I managed to get a fair distance ahead of the breakers. <em>Havre de Grace</em> and I pushed far rimward. We flew forty lunar distances into the murkreef, further than I&#39;ve ever been. After a quarter cycle, the breaker crews were at least two cycles behind me.</p>\n\n<p>I held my rimward course. Things were quiet like they usually were. I settled back, and while doing all the work, <em>Grace</em> flew silently through the void. Her old systems hummed along, and my mind grew restless.</p>\n\n<p>I prodded and poked at the inertial controls. Zooming in to the nav arrays, I played around with my readouts, hunting for any slight anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d almost given up when I noticed it.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing out of the ordinary. At first, it was a weak signal, like they usually were — a mere murmur. Changing course, I began the hunt. The needle of the gauge fluttered, I slowed and came about. I pulled around an enormous glacier, and it glistened white and blue. Flying close to its surface, I saw the shadow of my long narrow ship cast on its bright face. Once clear of the ice, the radiometer once again guided me. And once again I changed course to follow. The noisy signal began to strengthen, and I chased the ghost through the pale fog. The signal got stronger. I followed.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly I felt a jolt. The ship sputtered and jerked. I heard a crunch and felt a weightlessness in my chest. I hit the brakes. I shouted through the comm, my voice shaking. My heart pounded. The engine sputtered again. Pulled <em>Havre</em> around. My fingers were shaking.</p>\n\n<p>The instruments flickered and sputtered. Then silence. The entire ship went dark.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No.&quot; I said, my voice cracking. My heart sank, the pit in my stomach was growing.</p>\n\n<p>I had hit something. I wasn&#39;t sure what, but I lost all power. It was dark. As eyes began to adjust to the darkness, out the window in front of me emerged a colorless shape. I may not have seen it if the cabin lights were on. Had I not lost power, it would have been too faint.</p>\n\n<p>My eyes focused in on the blurry outline of the object in front of me. It was almost as if there was a gigantic dark wall floating amid the ice and rocks. My ship had stopped at the face of the mystery. My first thought was that it was an asteroid. Had a natural object been caught in the fog? It must have been a celestial body that had been thrown off course. Though, why would the radiometer lead me to this? I stared outside into the dense fog. </p>\n\n<p>Shaking, I gripped the controls and opened the throttles. Not a sound. The ship shuddered, but it was more like an aftershock, not power. The vessel said nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I thought to myself &quot;You&#39;re fine. It&#39;s an asteroid. Or maybe an old destroyer… I&#39;ve been out here alone too long.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ice began to collect on the windows of the cockpit.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>I unbuckled my harness and searched the dark cabin for the circuit breakers. I flicked them on, and the cockpit came to life.</p>\n\n<p>Forward lights illuminated the object in front of me. A closer inspection revealed rivets and seams. It was a ship.</p>\n\n<p>I was speechless. I was in awe. </p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t believe it, the hull of a massive and ancient craft floated ahead of me. The thing was many times the size of <em>Havre de Grace</em>. Closer still, my ship was almost flush against its side. There, I found scorch markings telling the tales of an embattled craft. I guided my tiny surveyor along the wall like hull, expecting to see the forward regions. Until it merely ended, torn like flesh, the metal had been ripped open. A stack of three decks lay exposed to space, frosted over with ice. Twisted metal and pipework overhung where the tear was made. I had never seen such a sight.</p>\n\n<p><em>Havre de Grace</em> and I shared a special moment in that silence. No one could hear me. No one could see me. It was mine.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing around the black shipwreck, I proceeded to the aft section through the swirling fog. Her six engines lay silent and cold, every one five times as large as <em>Havre de Grace</em>. The house-sized conical rocket bells were dented and dinged from the abuse of the rocks and ice flowing in the reef. I turned on the searchlight and began to inspect the wreck, looking for anything we could salvage. Above the engines, sat two stern chasers. Rearward facing cannons. A sure sign she was a ship of war, and it was old. Quite old. High on the stern boards, dusted in ice, was a decorated nameplate:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Leviathan</em>.&quot; I read it aloud.</p>\n\n<p>Sitting back in the <em>Graces&nbsp;</em>&#39;s only seat with a puzzled look on my face, I stared through the cabin window. An enormous husk of an ancient ship floated meters away, and my reflection appeared in the glass due to the blackness of the thing.</p>\n\n<p>What in the hell had I found? I fired the forward thrusters to back off her a little. With the breakers at least two cycles out, I had time to investigate. Maybe there was something of value still left onboard. Either way, this thing has got to be worth something, if only for the sheer amount of scrap metal.</p>\n\n<p>I asked myself, &quot;Was the I only scrapper to stumble upon this?&quot; My excitement faded, with the prospect that it could be picked clean. I had to investigate.</p>\n\n<p>Although it would be dangerous, and I was alone, I decided to go aboard. Leaving the stern of the menacing craft, <em>Havre de Grace</em> flew back to the large tear in the black hull. I positioned her, so one of the exposed decks was nearly level with the upper hatch of the command section. Luckily, the shipwreck was reasonably stable. I was able to match the listless rotation of the massive ship with ease.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Putting on a spacesuit always reminded me of the faceless men of my childhood working the helion mines on Tau Ogma. I didn&#39;t want that life. Nobody did. As a little girl, I witnessed tragedy upon tragedy. Collapses. Explosions. Families that torn apart by the treacherous lunar mines. These men spent a lifetime in a musty mildewed suit, crushing bits of moon rock for the Empire&#39;s diminished helion reserves. I was proud of leaving home, escaping the clutches of the mines, and venturing on my own. Granted, working the murkreef for Greem wasn&#39;t what I imagined I&#39;d be doing when I boarded a shuttle to Ogma City.</p>\n\n<p>As I rummaged through the storage locker in Grace&#39;s command area, I finally found what I was looking for - a bright orange space suit and matching equipment pack. These suits were usually reserved for short inspections of asteroids and ice flows, but I needed it for something a little more daring - boarding an abandoned ship. I unrolled the suit and pulled out the helmet and gloves that were stuffed haphazardly inside. As I examined the helmet, I noticed a round switch that controlled the lighting system. When I flipped it on, the lights shone a pale yellow.</p>\n\n<p>I stripped off my old grey sweater and comfortable pants, revealing my thin undershirt. On Tau Ogma, the moon I was born on, we were taught to take care of ourselves from a young age. The colonies there were rough and uncivilized, and I had grown to embrace the ruggedness of my life. I tossed my clothes and other loose items into the tunnel that connected the two ends of Havre De Grace, using it as an impromptu, decompression-safe storage area. I sealed the passage by placing the round hatch at the threshold and rotating it into place.</p>\n\n<p>Without an airlock, I would have to depressurize the crew area to open the outer hatch directly above me. So, I sat on the floor of the cabin against a circuit breaker panel and slipped into the empty space suit, starting with my feet and working my way up. As I pulled the rubbery legs over mine and slipped my feet into the protective boots, the suit&#39;s shell felt cold against my bare skin and smelled sweetly of stale perspiration. With my arms through the sleeves, I stood and strapped on the equipment pack, securing the yellowed glass helmet with my bare hands. I struggled to fasten the finicky connectors along the collar ring with my gloves on, a task that every miner knows is impossible. Finally, I connected the flexible hose from the equipment pack to the helmet and made sure there was enough clearance for me to move freely.</p>\n\n<p>As the suit pressurized and conformed to my body, I fidgeted around inside it, flexing my jaw to let my ears pop while the suit adjusted to fit me. Although the outer shell was stiff, the articulation points remained surprisingly flexible - a sign of a well-worn and comfortable suit.</p>\n\n<p>The left arm of my spacesuit had a small panel with gauges. There, next to the gravity indicator was the breathable air capacity. It read &quot;163&quot;, almost full. When ready, <em>Havre de Grace&nbsp;</em>&#39;s small command module depressurized quickly. When the breath left her lungs, I switched off the gravity generators and watched the gauge on my arm fall from 0.96g. Standing upright, the nauseating sensation of weightlessness gripped my senses. The disorientation washed over me when my inner ear signaled I was falling, but my body was standing still. The gravity field faded to nothing. I swallowed once more to adjust to the new pressure and took a few small steps around the cabin. Getting used to the microgravity took only a moment. With a jumping motion, I lifted off the floor. Unbounded by artificial gravity, my body floated towards the small door above the command seat.</p>\n\n<p>Through the hatch, I was starside. I lashed myself to my tiny ship, dwarfed in comparison floating next to <em>Leviathan</em>. A wispy fluorescent tether now attached my suit to a mounting point on the hull of <em>Havre de Grace</em>. Carefully, I climbed a narrow ladder on the starboard side of her cabin. From her external equipment bay, I removed the now weightless cutting gear from its securement — a tank of oxidizer, fuel and a cutting rod. Once free, the bundle of tools floated along my side, and we broached the gnarled fissure of the dark ship.</p>\n\n<p>It was dead black inside the husk. My helmet mounted lighting revealed only a narrow yellowish beam in the eerie passageways. Farther, with the tether in tow, I explored. This vessel was older than the Drenthe War. <em>Leviathan</em> was a rare relic indeed. From a time when ships were mighty and slow lumbering beasts. She bore the marks of many ferocious engagements. Combat in her day was brutal and held at close range. This ship was the stuff of legend. It was unlike anything I had ever seen or heard.</p>\n\n<p>Floating through its shadowy passageways, I sought treasure. Not unlike the pirates who once sailed this ship. Remnants of a bygone era were scattered throughout the wreck. Down the first corridor, a pair of once fine leather boots floated freely. When I reached out to touch them and the ancient footwear crumbed in my hands. They were frozen and frostbitten. Ravaged by time and the icy vacuum of space, like much of this ship. Deeper still, my list of ephemera grew. I found liquor bottles, old-fashioned tea tins, antiquated jackets, gloves, and hats. Nothing of much value at all. I all but confirmed I wasn&#39;t the first to search these lifeless decks. Still though, if we could haul it back, it might be at least worth its weight in metal.</p>\n\n<p>Along the main deck, I discovered the ship&#39;s mess and berthings. The hatches to the compartments were sealed shut. The doors, immovable since the hull had warped and deformed from time, battles and ice. Shining my light through a frosty porthole revealed a frozen galley. The room was lined with metal shelves and had an ancient range embedded in the far bulkhead. Pots and pans, dishes and food containers floated loosely in the compartment amid a cloud of icy food particles. Through the debris, I found the remains of the cook. His frozen corpse drifted lazily in his tomb. He had succumbed to the void, like the rest the souls aboard this ship.</p>\n\n<p>My tether grew short as I reached the aft bulkhead of the engine room. I marveled at the size and strength of the old power plants. Six rows of metal, piping, gauges, and valves comprised the array of engines. Each one stood two stories high. I stood in silence and awe of the masterpiece of engineering before me.</p>\n\n<p>Wanting to go further, but out of rope, I turned around to depart the wreck. I pulled myself along the taut tether. Tugging away, I collected and looped the line as I traveled back, carrying only my disappointment. Through the forward area of the engine room, the electrical generation equipment filled the rest of the compartment. Ducts and pipes darted in every direction, like the veins and arteries of the once-living, breathing animal. Had the ship been alive, the relay boxes and junctions lining the deck would send power and communications throughout the beast.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the forward lower deck of <em>Leviathan</em>, close to where her hull broke open, there was a series of storage bays. Something I hadn&#39;t noticed on my way in. They were empty, of course. Their contents lost to the vacuum of space. All except one. It was amidship, closest to where the crack in the hull leaked the life out of the ship was a sealed door. It&#39;s face scorched and burned from several failed attempts to cut it open. It sat locked but dented from several brute force attempts to reveal its insides.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t be able to get in, but I didn&#39;t bring the cutting tools with me for nothing. It was worth a shot, so I set up the tools, flipped the welding visor down, and lit the torch. At it&#39;s highest power, the long-handled device belted a storm of white sparks and blue fire at the door. After the flurry of flames, the metal was unscratched. No doubt, it was a vault. A safe room built to keep people out. There was no cutting into it, not without the shipbreakers – and they were still at least a cycle and a half out.</p>\n\n<p>There had to be some way to open this vault, &quot;How did the crew do it?&quot; I thought to myself, touching the dented and scorched door with my glove. </p>\n\n<p>I could feel the roughness of the damage of the door through the fingertips of the thick gloves.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, <em>their</em> ship had power.&quot; Staring at my high-visibility gloved finger against the leaden door, I continued that train of thought. &quot;When I was in the power generation compartment, there might have been a relay box I could tap into.&quot; I thought. &quot;They all looked like standard connectors.&quot; Old but standard. My mind continued. &quot;If I could divert power from <em>Grace</em> into the right relay, I might be able to get some systems to power up.&quot; And maybe this door would open. Maybe I&#39;d be rich. Maybe I&#39;d get my <em>own ship</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The power transfer cable on the Havre de Grace was too short to reach the relay junction in the aft section. Determined to find a solution, I scanned the area for another option. Punching a hole in the thick hull near the engine room was out of the question. Suddenly, I noticed the tear in the hull revealed a network of electrical and cooling conduits. Eureka! With a little luck, I could tap into those.</p>\n\n<p>I grabbed my torch and adjusted the power level. The layers of brittle material easily gave way under the intense heat, vaporizing in the vacuum of space. As the torch revealed a shiny metallic artery encased in colorful insulation, I knew I had hit the jackpot. It might not be the prettiest solution, but it would do.</p>\n\n<p>I floated back to the Havre de Grace, pulling my cutting equipment along with me. Once I reached the ship, I secured the torch and gas tanks to another mounting point and located the external power cable near the external equipment bay. The thick, black cable was insulated with a large coupling assembly on one end. I fired up my cutting tools and sliced off the end, stripping away the bulky coupling connector and exposing the high-power filaments. The coupling assembly drifted off into the void of space, leaving me with a thick, bare wire frayed with melted insulation.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the exposed conduit, I wedged the modified power transfer cable under a layer of insulation. To ensure a solid connection, I braced myself against the bulkhead and gave the cord a solid kick with my orange boot. The filaments sunk into the conduit like a needle piercing skin, and I watched with satisfaction as the bright insulation bulged around the splice. Sweating and triumphant, I stood back to admire my handiwork.</p>\n\n<p>I slowly lowered myself through the tiny hatch on the roof of my ship, feeling the familiar weightlessness of space as I descended. As I reached the floor, I could hear the rush of air as the cabin repressurized and the hum of the gravity generators as they turned back on. I reached for my gloves, feeling the cool, smooth material as I pulled them off, revealing my pale, natural fingers. I flexed them, relishing the sensation of the cool air against my skin.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I reached up and twisted the locking mechanism on my helmet, feeling the pop as it released. I pulled it off, feeling the cool air circulate through my hair and against my face. I could smell the faint scent of burnt insulation and metal, reminding me of my successful mission.</p>\n\n<p>As I stood in the cabin of my ship, I felt a sense of triumph wash over me. I looked around, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of my small home. The sound of the cooling fans humming in the background. The rustling of my suit as I moved. The quiet sounds of my ship as it drifted through space.</p>\n\n<p>With my helmet off, and slumping in the command chair, focused on my next order of business. I needed to coax <em>&nbsp;Havre de Grace</em> to do something both she and I would be uncomfortable doing – jumpstarting a several hundred lya old pirate ship.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past three seasons working for Greem, I developed an appreciation for older vessels. Both in tearing them to tiny bits, and living in them. The venerable Henry-class ships are far more flexible than today&#39;s modern vessels. After a quick, once over of the faded <em>Crew Procedures and Operations Manual</em> I was able to initiate a power transfer to the ancient <em>Leviathan</em>. Flipping the XFR switch, I watched through the tiny cabin window. <em>Grace</em> strained and groaned under increased load, but it worked. Rows of yellow porthole lights flicked on along the wreck&#39;s hull. The ghost was alive.</p>\n\n<p>After remembering I had launched a beacon earlier in the cycle, I decided to grab a radio. I wanted to be in contact in case the breakers showed up early, and I was out treasure hunting. Clipping it to my waist, I inserted its thin coiled cable into the back of my helmet next to the ventilation tube. For the radio, my ship would act as a relay. <em>Grace&nbsp;</em>&#39;s large omnidirectional antenna would amplify and transmit any incoming signals to the much weaker receiver on my helmet.</p>\n\n<p>With sweat still fresh in my suit, I was off again. Through the top hatch of the cabin, I entered the foggy reef. Standing once again on my ship&#39;s hull, I pushed off into the massive wound of <em>Leviathan</em>. This time, when I crossed the opening in the hull, there was gravity – a small amount, but it was there. After leaping, at mid-flight, my trajectory surprisingly turned towards the deck of the ghost ship. I was caught off guard, forcing me to make a clumsy but soft crash landing. Once aboard the wreck, I stood and was delighted to discover I was able to walk. My boots held to the deck by a weak gravitational force. I checked the readouts on my arm. The gravity indicator read 0.13g. Not much, but would be more than enough to walk the halls standing upright. From my waist, I removed my safety tether. It fell like a leaf, dropping in slow motion in the vacuum as the hands of gravity gently tugged it to the deck.</p>\n\n<p>The vault was only a few steps from the crack in the hull where I bungled my landing on the right side of the vault door at a small key-code panel. I must have missed it in the dark. It was iced over, coated in a layer of icy blue frost, it blended in with the bulkhead. Wiping the powdery snow away revealed an array of eight keys. Each with a familiar Athyian numeral. I had managed to get power to the ship, but now I needed the access code to the vault.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; I enjoyed my lonely sarcasm while staring at the key-panel and the locked vault.</p>\n\n<p>My left arm gauge read &quot;40&quot;. I didn&#39;t have much time. I was down to less than one-third of breathable air in my suit, plus reserves. With not a lot of time, I decided to make the most of it and see if any hatches that were previously closed could now be opened with the newfound power.</p>\n\n<p>Without a tether, I could have easily reached the far aft compartments on the upper deck of the ghost ship. A place I previously was unable to explore. There, I entered several staterooms. The rooms lined a short hallway, illuminated by a dim, golden overhead light. Each room was vacant, with hardly any items of real value, save the ephemera of life on this ancient ship. Nothing gave any hints to the access codes for the vault in the lower decks.</p>\n\n<p>The last stateroom I entered was, however, occupied. Upon entering the last small room, I found the frozen a body of an old sailor. He had fallen to the deck by the weak gravity force, along with many other small items strewn about the floor. I approached the frigid disfigured corpse, his old-style hat still in place. While visually examining it, I tried to quell any nausea that arose from seeing it&#39;s gruesome, discolored, and frozen flesh. </p>\n\n<p>I moved to the back of the room, where a small, well preserved wooden desk held maps, charts, and other navigational items. I searched the desk and the area surrounding it. Years of zero gravity scattered the once organized desk. It was useless to search everywhere. My attention turned to the corpse. His dark beard frozen over in blue ice, the same that covered the keypad of the vault. I approached the lifeless man, stepping over various clothing and silverware that had landed when the gravity was reactivated.</p>\n\n<p>His body lay on the floor, arms reaching upward like a fallen statue. Holding my breath and peering through the foggy glass of my helmet, I extended my hand out to touch the corpse. Through my glove, I felt the snowy texture of the corpse&#39;s frozen anatomy. With merely a tap, his arm broke free of the body. I gasped in fear, and suddenly releasing my held breath. The arm tumbled through the vacuum of space in slow motion, until falling to the floor of the ancient sate room.</p>\n\n<p>I sensed there was more to this body. His uniform and possessions all looked expensive. At least for the time period. I took a deep breath, faced the one-armed corpse, and proceeded to check all of his pockets. There simply wasn&#39;t time to waste. If I was going to find the code, it was here and now.</p>\n\n<p>His pockets tore easily. First his left, then his right. After a healthy rip of the material on his right side, a small cylindrical object fell to the floor. Surprised, I turned and picked it up. My helmet shined lamps on its surface. I discovered ammunition, unlike any kind I had ever seen before. The outer casing of the round was etched. There was a scene of lakes, mountains, and forests. On the opposite side were the words &quot;Keleisa Prime&quot; cut in a beautiful swash script. Having no idea what it was at the time, I stuffed it into my utility pouch and checked the air level on my right arm. I read the amount aloud &quot;21&quot;, and released a sigh.</p>\n\n<p>Before heading back to wait for the breakers to arrive, I decided to check the corpse over once more. Gently feeling for anything with my gloved hands, I worked up from his torso, lightly crunching his slow like flesh along the way. I was relieved when I finally removed his hat. There, in the brim of his old leather hat, was a small numeric inscription along the rim. It was faded from hundreds of years of ice murk and darkness, but it was legible. </p>\n\n<p>It took a moment for me to register what I had found, but as soon as I did, I snatched the hat and hurried out of the stateroom. Upon exiting, I nearly slipped on an ice patch. I was running in low gravity as if I was moving in slow motion. Stumbling through the dark passages, I made my way to the breach.</p>\n\n<p>While moving, amid my hurried breaths, a faint crackle came through the headset in my helmet. The breakers will be elated, I thought. I tried to stop myself quickly to hear better the single my ships antenna was relaying to my helmet. Another call was repeated, slightly stronger, and clearer. To my dismay, the voice was not the breaker crew. Worried, I picked up my pace again, now on the lower deck, I could see the breach. </p>\n\n<p>Our crew had encountered reef raiders before. They tend to shoot first and questions later. I thought if it was them, they couldn&#39;t be trusted, even if this hulking cruiser was a worthless pile of metal and ice. I needed to get whatever was in the vault, and get out while I could. </p>\n\n<p>The third radio call was the most distinct. The first part was in a language I had never heard and didn&#39;t understand. The last part of the call was in broken Athylian.<br/></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Shèfarth responding to emergency location signal.&quot; The voice explained through the static.</p>\n\n<p>At that moment, the pieces came together. Powering on <em>Leviathan</em> had activated her emergency locator beacon, And a nearby ship must have picked up the signal.</p>\n\n<p>They weren&#39;t raiders. At least not the ones I was familiar with. However, that didn&#39;t instill much hope in me of them being friendly.</p>\n\n<p>The voice continued in an unintelligible language alternating in Athylian. I rushed to the vault door from the aft lower decks of <em>Leviathan</em>. With each radio call, the voice was clearer. They must have been getting closer and closer to each moment. With the dead sailor&#39;s hat in hand, I ignore the calls and focus on getting to the vault.</p>\n\n<p>The vault door stood as I left it. Locked and cold. I brushed off the keypad and transcribed the numeric symbols from the brim of the hat into the door&#39;s lock mechanism. All while the incoming ship is repeating the calls, it&#39;s voice resonating in my helmet. </p>\n\n<p>I transcribe the code into the lock. When the last key was pressed, a small light above the array of eight symbols illuminated bright green. I took two steps to my left and positioned myself in the threshold of the door. My plan was to grab whatever was in there, and get out before whoever was coming around showed up.</p>\n\n<p>Before I could even look up, the vault opened. And in an instant, a blast of air knocked me off my feet. The strongroom had survived hundreds of lya without losing atmosphere. It had still been pressurized. As if a grenade of breathable air went off, I lost my balance and tumbled forward. Crashing helmet first into the deck, my feet had flown upward flipping my body. With a crash, I flew into the bulkhead across from the vault.</p>\n\n<p>I was wincing from the pain of my forehead striking the deck of the ship. I opened my eyes and discovered a crack in the glass of my helmet. Bits of glass broke off, and air rushed and whistled through the growing crack. I could hear only my oxygen escaping, venting into space. Still, on the ground, I scrambled to seal the leak. Rolling over, I pressed the glove off my right hand on the glass, but the crack was too large, I couldn&#39;t stop the venting of my suit. More pieces of glass broke and were sucked into the vacuum of space.</p>\n\n<p>Something warm began to cloud my vision. I blinked. Blood poured from a wound on my forehead, dripping into my eyes and running down my face and cheeks.</p>\n\n<p>I laid there, helpless. One eye open. Holding my gloved hand to my crippled life support system. On the same arm that is preventing a total failure, I watch and listen, as my air level drops.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow I managed to regain sight of the breach through my shattered helmet. I began to crawl, keeping the gloved hand on the crack. With each step, I spent more air. The air was dropping too fast for me to make it.</p>\n\n<p>The headset of my helmet alarmed wildly as the reserve air depletion warning sounded, amid the calls of the unknown ship. My air leak grew further.</p>\n\n<p>I drifted away. My world became colder. And darker. And the voices of the radio calls faded away. The abyss of space welcomed me into the oblivion.</p>\n\n<h1>3</h1>\n\n<p>Am I dead?</p>\n\n<p>In the darkness, I could feel my aching body lying upon a smooth, stable surface. Under my neck was a small bunched up pillow. I opened my eyes to a field of blotchy colors, but there was no cracked helmet in my field of vision any longer — no pirate ship. No Vault. My body, bruised, and sore. My heavy arms touch the back of my head and move forward to my forehead where I discover a bandage.</p>\n\n<p>An explosion of incomprehension and shock hit me.</p>\n\n<p>Am I alive?</p>\n\n<p>Where am I?</p>\n\n<p>My raspy, dry lips barely move. &quot;Argh...&quot; I exclaimed into the strange room I&#39;d found myself in. There was no reply, apparently I was alone.</p>\n\n<p>Everything hurt. I was laying on a small, narrow bed near the corner of a dimly lit room. My feet dangled off the edge of the thing. It was too short for me, ending only in the middle of my calves. This was surprising, as I&#39;m not a tall person. As I peered around, I saw the walls were lined with various storage canisters, tubes, and hoses — a ship. I&#39;m on a ship.</p>\n\n<p>The blood from the cut on my forehead must have dried, but it was still tender. I didn&#39;t want to move, but I had to... I had to know where I was. I sat up and examined my abdomen, my chest, my head –&nbsp;all the places that hurt. I breathed in deep and examined my lungs. I can still breathe. I decided this was not a dream.</p>\n\n<p>Above me was a small moveable light hanging from the exposed metal rafters. Was this area a makeshift medical bay? A former storage room turned operating room? But where? And who found me?</p>\n\n<p>I pulled the tubes out of my head and started to get up, so that I could gather my things. Once erect, I found I was still wearing my orange spacesuit. I glanced at my arms, looking them over for any additional damage to the old suit. My gloves had been removed, as well as my damaged helmet and equipment pack. These items were now sitting next to me on a portable low metal table. The high visibility backpack that made up the space suit&#39;s life support system had been badly damaged. One of the bright orange air tanks dangled, dislodged from its holder. The force that slammed me into the bulkhead must have been tremendous.</p>\n\n<p>Wait, hit the bulkhead? I remembered it then. I&#39;d lost oxygen pressure. Feeling suddenly cold, I turned to my side and coughed. It echoed throughout the brisk storage room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ugh. Where in the gods–&quot;my raspy words were cut off by a cough.</p>\n\n<p>As the sound of by bodily heaving subsided, I heard only the droning of the engines and ventilation fans. Equipment was stacked high along the walls in an unorganized fashion. There were old avionics stacks, modulus computers, waveguides and other starship parts in various states of disrepair. On the far side of the room sat a door, metal with a rounded arch, it was shorter than a typical hatch on a starship. The exit hatch was the only area of the walls not lined with miscellaneous equipment.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hello?&quot; I say aloud, hoping I wasn&#39;t alone in this strange ship. I fully sat up and rotated my body to dismount the low lying bed. My feet, still in the boots of the spacesuit, plopped to the floor. I stood amid the piles of junk.</p>\n\n<p>My legs felt weak and woozy. I stumbled a bit then found my footing. I took another step and I stumbled again. My arms outstretched to catch my balance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Is anyone there?&quot; My voice sounded on the stagnant air.</p>\n\n<p>I stepped toward the door. &quot;Hello?&quot; I tried again. Still nothing.</p>\n\n<p>While walking toward the small hatch, I rubbed the back of my sore neck. Walking, I accidentally knocked over a small pile of pipes and metal tubes. They crashed to the floor. The room was a mess. I looked around a bit, trying to understand where I was.</p>\n\n<p>Only a few steps in and the sound of metal clanking startled me. Someone or something was at the hatch, opening it. It creaked and groaned open, swinging into the storage room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; I said, turning around to face the newly open hatchway.</p>\n\n<p>There in the doorway stood a small, furry creature. It appeared to be a member of the crew, with a uniform and a cap. He or she was covered in white and tan fur. Standing on its two legs, It examined at me with its animal-like dark eyes. It held its position until the door had opened fully, exposing the storage room to the hallway. Behind the animal, the hall was dark and deserted.</p>\n\n<p>The creature had flattened skull, and upright triangular ears with a pointed, upturned snout. It stepped toward me, cautiously at first. After a moment, as if it had recognized be me, it charged on all fours. Once close enough to touch my suit, it snorted and snuffled as it smelled me head to toe. During its investigation, its short tail wagged and poked through a rear opening it&#39;s dark uniform.</p>\n\n<p>Completely perplexed, I was dumbfounded. After the creature had thoroughly explored my body, it scurried in a little circle and settled lower to the ground. The animal&#39;s face was inches from mine. Both above and below its chin extended a forehead patch, over which were a pair of small sweeping whiskers. The creature brought its sniffing mouth closer to me, snapping it&#39;s mandible open and closing. The tip of it&#39;s pointed nose was a bluish black color.</p>\n\n<p>I stared at the creature, trying to understand what had happened.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; I chimed, trying not to sound too confident. </p>\n\n<p>The creature lowered its head, seemingly avoiding eye contact. It&#39;s long forearms rested on the floor, and its high knuckled hands were splayed against the deck. The animal extended its right leg beside me as if it was sniffing or feeling the area beneath it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Can you understand me?&quot; I asked, speaking slowly.</p>\n\n<p>The creature froze, apparently afraid.</p>\n\n<p>I tried again.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Did you find me?&quot; I say out loud, forming my words carefully. &quot;Do... do you know me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The animal&#39;s head moved from side to side. I took this to mean &quot;No&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What happened to me?&quot; I ask. The creature did not respond. My thoughts were really starting to become clearer. &quot;Do you know what happened to me? Do you understand?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The creature stared at me with its dark eyes. Then, seeming to understand my words, it scurried around to the front of me and with a squeal, it took my hand and led me out of the storage room. The furred thing dragged me through the halls of a cluttered and disorganized ship. We stumbled over piles of electrical rigging, fittings, and rubbish. At one point, I had to duck to avoid slamming my head onto an exposed pipe after making a sharp turn. As it scrambled, it would every so often use its free upper arm to propel itself. All the while, making sounds of all sorts. Sniffs, snorts, squeals, and clicks. I had no idea what it was saying, but I could tell it was excited.</p>\n\n<p>We made several turns, though I had no idea where, to come at last to the ship&#39;s bridge. The animal, or person, or creature, stopped abruptly. It straightened its body in anticipation. The squeals, snorts, and clicks grew louder as it took me by the hand again and led me up some beige colored stairs.</p>\n\n<p>We proceeded up a narrow stairwell and arrived in what appeared to the command center of the ship. There, we encountered several more creatures of its kind, all at their stations, operating and monitoring the craft. They turned to look at me, each one with their triangle ears poking through small hats. The fur of these fox-like creatures were varied tones of browns and tans. Some had bright white fur tips on their ears and snouts. I felt their stares, and could only assume this was a strange occurrence for them. It sure was for me. They all clamored to get a look at me and made inquisitive sounds in unison.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge too, like the rest of the ship was cluttered and in total disarray. A small, slatted window was at the fore of the room, and through it was the bright hull of the ship jutting into space. The bridge appeared to be in the aft looking forward. I could see the ship through the window, it was long and thin, but had a multitude of protruding sections.</p>\n\n<p>The creature who escorted me to the bridge released my hand. It ran toward who I assumed was the captain near the middle of the control room. They conversed in their squealing language, with the eager creature standing on hind legs, gesturing with his front. After some discussion, the captain left his charts and maps at his station at and approached me. The other crewmen continued their work oblivious to our presence, focused and intent on their tasks.</p>\n\n<p>The captain came toward me, scrutinizing me closely. It was a tan colored fox-like creature, one of the most distinguished looking ones I had seen. The captain was taller and more slender than the ones previously encountered on the ship. &quot;You&#39;re alive.&quot; He said in Athylian with a surprisingly deep voice. &quot;To say the least, we are... surprised.&quot; The captain continued while standing shorter than I, looking up. &quot;I thought we had lost you. We thought you were past saving.&quot; He touched the arms of my suit, possibly to verify I was real.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Can you understand me?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; I told him directly. &quot;What happened? Where am I?&quot; I asked the creature. He had a grey muzzle, his fur and whiskers appeared more wiry, more aged than the others. His ears were pointed at the top and had white tips. Both ears and the face showed many whiskers. And he had a long thin dark patch on his forehead.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We were underway to Port Bethany when we discovered an emergency signal in the reef. Lucky for you we had slowed to do some scavenging.&quot; He spoke slowly and clearly. &quot;When we arrived, you were unconscious. My first officer thought it wise to bring you aboard.&quot; He paused. I wasn&#39;t sure if the captain also felt that way. &quot;Our ship, <em>Shèfarth</em> is... how can I put this? <em>Unequipped</em> to provide medical services to a creature such as yourself.&quot; He gestured at the size of my body in relation to his own. &quot;It would be impossible to assist you without life support measures, and that is a luxury we cannot afford.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So, you brought me on board the <em>Shèfarth</em> in an attempt to save my life.&quot; I said, putting pieces together. &quot;Correct.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I looked at a nearby window that had a view of space. The window was small and blurry at the edges. It had thick wavy panes of glass divided by a single white trim. I was thankful the <em>Shèfarth</em> was able to rescue me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Honestly, thank you.&quot; I said and thought for a moment, &quot;Who... or... what are you?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We have a long past. It is not familiar to many outsiders. Our people originally come from what you may know as Drenthe Region.&quot; He stopped for a moment to watch my body language, to see if I appeared to recognize what he&#39;s saying. I remained motionless. &quot;Once, before your time, we were called the Thrune. We were one of the founding tribes of the Mer Empire. For a very long time, we were it&#39;s highest authority.There, a great war long ago led our race to the exodus. Our world was decimated. Famine took hold, we retreated to the planet Riktor in search of sanctuary.&quot; He paused for a moment, as if recalling his people&#39;s history was hard to define, so I assumed it was. &quot;As I said, it was long, long ago. Today we live here, on this reef. And have for many generations.&quot; He explained. &quot;It is our home now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Reef dwellers. I nodded slowly, taking in his story. &quot;Are there many of you left?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We are the only ones of the exodus we know. The journey of our race scattered our people through the galaxy.&quot; He said with a tone of sadness in his voice. &quot;The majority of our kind... died during our exodus.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know what to say. My heart went out to the captain and the others. So many lives sacrificed for the life of their race. I felt sorrow for them, for their ordeal. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I told him sincerely.</p>\n\n<p>He squinted his head, and his dark and light markings looked like eyelashes. &quot;No need to be. We are what we are. Our people&#39;s fate was determined long before we ever achieved the stars.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded. We stepped back to the captain&#39;s station where there were navigational documents scattered on a low desk. &quot;We&#39;ve resumed course. Bethany, a distant port.&quot; He tapped his sort, furry finger to a point on the map. &quot;There, we&#39;ll barter, then return to the reef.&quot; He told me, before asking, &quot;What may we call you?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal,&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal. Yes, unfortunately, we will be leaving you there.&quot; The captain became more serious, &quot;My crew and those living on this ship are skeptical of outsiders. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do more.&quot; He looked away and frowned.</p>\n\n<p>I remained motionless, watching the captain. I could tell that he had more to tell me, something else pressing on his mind. Thinking, I stayed silent.</p>\n\n<p>We stood there for a few moments, not saying anything. I got the sense these creatures weren&#39;t used to visitors. And that my situation has become an issue. His eyes wavered, avoiding my gaze. Trying to be patient and reassuring with his wavering eyes, I stood before the captain and continued. &quot;Captain,&quot; I said, thinking of <em>Havre de Grace</em>. &quot;What about my ship?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>The captain nodded, raised his hand and squealed, barking several unintelligible tones. A member of the crew left his station and approached the captain and me. </p>\n\n<p>The tall figure had big eyes and pointed ears, a mostly white face with black and brown whiskers. The captain spoke to him in their language. I listened, the sounds were harsher and higher pitched than the captain&#39;s who was speaking. I couldn&#39;t make out a word.</p>\n\n<p>After their conversation, the captain turned to me. &quot;My officer, Cetka, will escort you to your ship.&quot; He said. As Cetka turned to leave, the captain stopped him, then looked down at me, squinting his face. &quot;I don&#39;t know what might be left. Maybe nothing. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; The captain said.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing? The thought saddened me. <em>Havre de Grace</em> was a place I had called home. And more important was the fact that it didn&#39;t belong to me. I didn&#39;t have any claim over it and I&#39;d owe Greem a great deal of money if I lost it. I didn&#39;t want to put Greem in any sort of position where he might feel he had to pay me.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded. The creature led me out of the bridge and into one of the many cargo bays below the bridge. We passed many sections with numerous crew members. Many more were occupied with mechanical duties, repairs, various tasks and duties. Some visibly looked at us with the same uncertainty and doubt that the captain had. They snorted and turned away when they saw me, but the curious ones watched me.</p>\n\n<p>We entered the docking bay where my ship was kept. There I found piles of equipment scavenged from <em>Leviathan</em>. Amid the junk was the entire forward module of a Henry-class survey ship. <em>Havre de Grace</em> had been gutted. It was now in a state of disrepair. The interior modules were strewn across the deck. The life support system looked stripped. The remnants of the ship&#39;s fuel had dried into a white chalk-like rust on the hull. Avionics, gravity systems, and every valuable part had been surgically removed and strewn about the cargo area. There was no recognizable outline of where <em>Havre de Grace</em> had formerly been. I stepped into the docking area and looked around. When I&#39;d stopped, Cetka stayed back.</p>\n\n<p>My shoulders dropped. I felt even more helpless. I could never hope to repay the debt for this. &quot;What... Happened?&quot; I asked the Cetka. He didn&#39;t speak my language and told me so with a squealing bark. I watched the creature for a moment. His large eyes focused in on me with curiosity. Then he began to examine the wreckage. He poked at pieces of the ship.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to myself, knowing the creature wouldn&#39;t understand me, &quot;What am I going to do? Where am I going to go?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cetka took a few pieces of metal. I watched him. He gathered the pieces of metal and walked to the wall behind <em>Havre de Grace</em>&#39;s remains. He tugged at a few wires, then picked up a cord that was attached to a piece of panel.</p>\n\n<p>My head lowered, I took a step back, &quot;No, Cetka, no. Don&#39;t touch that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cetka turned, and looked at me with a puzzled expression, until he saw what I meant. He barked, then dropped the cord at his feet. He looked at me again, then scampered back to join the other crew in a work area.</p>\n\n<p>I stepped back to <em>Havre de Grace</em> and looked around her remains. &quot;No, no.&quot; I said to myself, &quot;Just no.&quot; The feeling of hopelessness rose inside me. I became aware of how my hands were shaking as I stood. I took a slow and deep breath, trying to calm myself, to hold myself together.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Greem is going to kill me. He&#39;s going to find me.&quot; I said, shaking my head. &quot;And then I may as well be dead.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Finding an uncomfortable seat on a pile of debris, I scooted back from the ship and sat. I leaned against a piece of equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there was a stillness about the area, a hush that seemed out of place. I felt the quiet, almost peaceful, as if I was sitting among the dead. All the crew in the cargo bay were occupied. I remained alone. I pulled my knees into my arms and hugged them. I thought about Greem and how he would react to what I&#39;d done. He did not have the a reputation for patience and forgiveness. He did not suffer fools very well or those who were careless with their responsibilities. And my undertaking turned out to be both.</p>\n\n<p>I began to sob, crying for my lost ship, for my lost world and what little I had left, crying because I had let myself get in this position, crying because I was alive.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I would spend several days aboard <em>Shèfarth</em> before we arrived in the Orylia system. During the trip, I got to know some of the crew, as most of the officers spoke at least partial Athylian. A member of the steward&#39;s department introduced me to many of the traditional Drenthe dishes served onboard. Starting with a cold pickled poultry dish.</p>\n\n<p>Before me, placed upon a featureless white plate was a colorless lump of flesh. Brined and pickled for three cycles it was served cold. This was of course the first time I&#39;d ever had the chance to eat Drenthe cuisine. The steward explained to me that the dish was made from the <em>Ptythar</em>, a native avian found on the Drenthe homeworld. The bird was small, only four to six kilos on average. The method of preservation was nearly as old as the Drenthe people. The steward explained to me that this was a traditional shipboard food and that it was usually served with a side of whatever vegetables were in the ship&#39;s stores. The pickled bird was a little tough and chewy but not unpleasant. The taste was very salty and acidic and quite strong. The steward told me that that it was usually served with a side of fresh vegetables and a small portion of Ztla, a Drenthe equivalent of bread.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Try it.&quot; My new smirking friend said. His snout was curling up at the edges with a devilish smile. Oh, what a delight for them.</p>\n\n<p>In the dim light, I could feel the other members of the crew at the table waiting to eat so they wouldn&#39;t miss my reaction.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is it called?&quot; I asked my new friend.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Tzarlth</em>.&quot; He replied.</p>\n\n<p>I serve myself a small portion of the pickled bird and a few vegetables, and tried a little bit of the bread. I was sure they were all watching my reaction, waiting to see if I liked it or not.</p>\n\n<p>On my palette, the pickled bird was salty and acidic with a strong flavor. The texture was a little tough and chewy. The bread was dense and chewy as well. Overall, it wasn&#39;t a bad experience. I could see why it was a traditional shipboard food. It was easy to store and didn&#39;t require any special preparation.</p>\n\n<p>After watching me, The paused officers sitting around the table began to eat. They did not use utensils. Instead, they lowered their heads, snouts turned sideways and chewed. Moments into the meal, a lower-ranking crew member approached the table and filled our metal cups with white glin, an Orylian mead.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal.&quot; One officer sitting two places to my left said. </p>\n\n<p>I looked up at him from my plate chewing slowly. &quot;Mm?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m curious. What were you doing so deep in the reef? We rarely have visitors at this depth you know.&quot; He said speaking from his greying whiskered muzzle.</p>\n\n<p>I swallowed the bite of bird and cleared my throat. The other crew members continued their meals as stewards brought seconds.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Same as you, I suppose. Looking for... anything. Anything of value.&quot; I replied and took a sip of the glin. It tasted of honey and salt. Glin was made from the fermented juice of the Orylian karax fruit. The karax was a small yellow berry that grew on salt bushes near the coastlines of the Orylia. I&#39;ve had it before, it&#39;s dryer than most fruits with a sour aftertaste.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Find anything?&quot; He asked. I wasn&#39;t sure where he was going, even if I did find something they would have it after breaking Hulume&#39;s <em>Havre de Grace</em> in half.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;On the wreck? No.&quot; I paused. &quot;I surely wasn&#39;t the first to salvage it. It seems as though it was picked over.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He looked at me skeptically. &quot;Well. Neither did we.&quot; He said after a moment. I got the feeling they were hiding something. We ate for a moment, and the sounds of snarling and chewing ensued. </p>\n\n<p>I caught a member of the crew looking up at the officer, and glance at me. I noticed him. The telegraph had been sent. The crewman realized what he was doing and went back to his meal.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well.&quot; I said as a couple of ears perked up but didn&#39;t stop eating to appear as though they weren&#39;t listening.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Just before I fell, I opened a strange door. Almost as if it were a vault.&quot; I said. &quot;Could have been something in there. However, I wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hm.&quot; He said and let it linger. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t know about it. We&#39;re all glad you&#39;re alive.&quot; He turns to his fellow officers and gestures into the air with his cup. Some offer a quick toast by raising their glasses without looking up from their meals. Others continue to converse or eat — snouts buried in the musty pickled bird.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The scavenging nature of these reef dwellers meant they had some of my sized clothes onboard. With the amount of junk on board, I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if they had one of everything. Before the night was over, I was taken to a warehouse of sorts, where a salvaged shipping container of clothing had been stashed. I didn&#39;t ask where they found it. Inside were crates of newly sewn clothes, bound for the empire. The haul was a veritable boutique, including skirts, dresses, shirts, blouses, gloves, hats, pretty much everything. Also, imperial women seemed to have exquisite judgment. The items were of the highest quality, if not too ostentatious for my taste.</p>\n\n<p>In the container, I discovered a long, simple dress with a matching wrap. It was a dark affair, with a full satin waist. It paired nicely with a dainty white shirt I found hanging amid the stolen wares. The shirt had a high collar with narrow sleeves, as was the fashion. Tight at the lower arm and puffed out at the upper section. Overlaying the garments on the tattered spacesuit covering my torso, I felt like royalty. I pressed the clothing against my body, with no mirror I had to imagine the fitment. I supposed it would work, although I&#39;ve never worn such a thing.</p>\n\n<p>With my clothing selection in hand, I made my way through the littered passageways. I thought of the vault. What was inside it? Did they open it? I knew these reef dwellers were keeping <em>something</em> from me. But why? And what was it they found?</p>\n\n<p>I got back to my sparse quarters with a full belly and a pile of new clothes in hand. The questions of what they had found, still fresh in my mind. Emptying out the utility pouch I had removed from my spacesuit, a shiny bullet fell onto the metal floor with a clink.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, hello.&quot; I said aloud to it, remembering how we met.</p>\n\n<p>I picked it up the more substantial than expected piece of ammunition. The etching was masterful. I read the minute words aloud. &quot;Keleisa Prime.&quot; It was the name of an original imperial colony.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well. At least I found you.&quot; I said as I kicked the boots off my musty space suit, eager to get into clean clothes.</p>\n\n<p>The garments I selected fit well. Once dressed, I turned and pressed the black fabric down my side. I hadn&#39;t bathed in what felt like weeks, not since leaving Baysia and boarding <em>Grace</em> so this was comforting. I adjusted myself further, flattening the satin waist, I relished the softness and breathability of the new garments. Although categorically I preferred working clothes, overalls and work pants, none of this bustled business. I asked myself if Athylian Nobel women ever have to change the fluid on a heat exchanger? Or ever have to run <em>anywhere</em> at all?</p>\n\n<p>I made the most of it, though. Royalty for a day, I decided. It might even have helped me hide from Greem if he came looking. I was sure he would not be pleased. The breakers had probably found my beacon by then. I wondered what they were going to do.</p>\n\n<p>As I finished tying and tucking my hair back, the ship began to tremble. A tremor came over the large craft, sounds of straining metal shook everything and anything. We were coming out of faster than light travel. With a jolt, the rumbling stopped, and a bell sounded throughout the ship. The speaker system clicked on, the crackled language of the reef dwellers echoed through the disheveled halls announcing our arrival in the Orylia System.</p>\n\n<h1>4</h1>\n\n<p>The reef dwellers and I had arrived in the Orylia System. It wasn&#39;t until I made my way through the docking connector that saw how large their ship was. Through the tiny round windows of the ramp, I saw what I had been aboard — a long, flat craft with squarish features. Bits of roughened metal and pipework separate each of the many cargo doors. Atop the aft section sits the bridge and habitation areas. It was hard to recognize after only seeing it from the inside out. </p>\n\n<p>An eclectic group of furry creatures led me down a private passageway. The quiet hall led into and into the market district of Breehl. Along the journey, they conversed in their language. Some carried sacks or pushed wobbly carts piled with scavenged goods. The white tips of their tails dragged low behind them. The lead creature carried nothing. Instead, it acted as a pathfinder. A protector. It&#39;s triangle shaped ears on full alert as the creature led the pack to a trading area. With its stout nose, it sniffed ahead the group hauling their merchandise some lengths behind them. There is a sense of unspoken, almost invisible, coordination.</p>\n\n<p>I wondered, what was their motivation for saving me? Nobody in the reef does anything for anyone without wanting something in return. These creatures were like nothing I&#39;ve ever encountered, both physically and culturally. I looked at the captain, now wearing an everyday brown outfit, and wondered if he and his people were saviors or deceptive.</p>\n\n<p>My group and I proceeded through the halls and passages of the restless Breehl district. After moving through the crowded city, we arrived at a large open-air market. Countless vendors and shops lined the overflowing paths. Their wares and patrons spilled into the streets with a clamor. Thousands of creatures from every reach of the galaxy, all shopped, sold and dealt in a cacophony of mercantilism. The marketplace area was made up of two long main streets that run parallel for some time until converging at a clock tower near the far end of the market. These two main thoroughfares are always packed with shoppers, except during the night cycle. Proceeding into this main drag further would lead to what&#39;s left of the space elevator, the rest of Breehl, and the far docking platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Breehl central market offers a limitless variety of goods and wares. Exotic teas, bulk produce, live and butchered animals, textiles, tools, even entire ships. The market seems to have an unlimited supply of every kind of thing you could ever imagine. It&#39;s a bustling bazaar with an overwhelming number of vendors and buyers. The Breehl market&#39;s crowd is nothing less than a people zoo, with strangers from all walks of life and every corner of the galaxy crammed together.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the items traded or sold there were obtained by legitimate means. Some though, were not. And others? Even asking could put you in danger. This is a place where anything could happen. And it often does.</p>\n\n<p>The guide creature led us midway into the central bazaar. I was nearly overwhelmed by the smell of local fish eggs a vendor was mashing into a dark, putrid paste. I wasn&#39;t sure if I was more surprised by the smell or the fact that the creature was preparing to jar and sell it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What could that be?&quot; I asked aloud and turned looked to see if I was the only one whose nose was revolting.</p>\n\n<p>Searching for an answer to my rhetorical question, two reef dwellers of our group had been stopped by curious patrons. Pulled aside, they began to converse with interested customers. The inquisitive party comprised of two tall, thin creatures with smooth pale skin and tiny eyes. They wore red wraps atop their oblong heads and gestured slowly as they spoke broken Perseid.</p>\n\n<p>Our group carried on without them.</p>\n\n<p>Near the middle of the market, we stopped in front of an old doorway at street level. Above it sat a modest wooden sign, painted with white Perseid script. After the captain performed a quick count of the group, we proceeded past a thick guard wearing dark clothes. His ample body did not fit well on his small stool he was perched atop. The man looked us over, recognized the captain, and with a lazy hand gesture waved us through. Without lifting from his stool, we passed and traveled through a dingy carpeted hallway. Although the sound of our footsteps was muffled by the stained carpet, our presence was obvious as the wide wooden floor creaked under our feet. The dwellers pushed their carts and hauled their sacks until we reached the large closed door.</p>\n\n<p>Before we came to a stop, the door was opened from the inside. Through the double-wide opening, we entered into a large complex of interconnected rooms. The group found their way deeper. Each room had vendors with their goods laid upon long tables. Each distinct area was set up to present valuable goods with display cases, bins, boxes, jewelry stands, and hand-painted signage. This was an emporium, where only the finest goods were offered, and from the looks of the items, it was for those with deep pockets, and a keen taste.</p>\n\n<p>The group of furry creatures and I made our way through the crowded main hall. We passed an unusual gem dealer and proceeded against his beckoning to a smaller room near the back of the building. There, we found a single member of the crew who had arrived earlier, she was sitting alone at the long table. Upon seeing us, she sat up from her chair and greeted our group their native language. Her ears folded back as she nuzzled a creature who had been traveling with us. I could not understand the language, but it did not matter, her warmth was welcomed by the tired creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Our well lit and room had only a long table with some flimsy chairs and a short staircase leading to the next room. Through the open door and into the next room, I could see piles and piles of colorful textiles, hung from rods and laid perfectly on a long table exactly like ours. The sheets of fine cloth were patterned, ornate, and looked expensive.</p>\n\n<p>One reef dweller emptied his sack onto the table. Small pieces of equipment, control panels, condensers, valves, and an array of other items spilled from his large canvas colored bag onto the table. It wasn&#39;t long before the crates were unloaded and the bags emptied. Those who had no goods to sell helped arrange the items, while others sorted the litany.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is where we must say goodbye, Amal.&quot; The captain said. He had been watching the group unload for the morning of sales.</p>\n\n<p>I nod, hesitant to thank the creature who destroyed my ship, and yet saved my life. &quot;Thank you.&quot; I thought it wise.</p>\n\n<p>His ears pitched backwards and he looked at me. &quot;This isn&#39;t enough to get you home... It&#39;s all we can give.&quot; The captain handed me a five-mark imperial coin. It was scoret colored, with seven sides, like all imperial coins. He nodded. His grey muzzle dipped to reveal it&#39;s length as he bowed his head. A stripe of dark fur ran from the tip of his nose to where his dark eyes sat.</p>\n\n<p>I knew that it wasn&#39;t enough. I knew that I was stranded. And, this coin was probably all I had until I could find some work. But at least, I had a way to feed myself and perhaps I could find a way to get to a transport bound for Baysia. Though, I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to go back, I was terrified of what Greem would do to me once he saw me again. I&#39;d destroyed one of his ships and abandoned the breakers. How would he react? Likely with violence. I&#39;d heard of his punishments, and they were not pleasant.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Be well, Amal.&quot; He spoke again, and walked back to the table and scanned the items he and his crew were selling.</p>\n\n<p>I took the coin and tucked it into the dark colored wrap that layered my scavenged couture. I&#39;d almost forgotten about the cut of cloth in which I was covered. It dawned on my Imperial high class appearance wouldn&#39;t match the amount of coin I held.</p>\n\n<p>Customers began filing in. Throughout the emporium, the reef dwellers were the only ones bringing these types of goods. A survey of the other tables and rooms would reveal luxury goods, gemstones, jewelry, clothing, and the like. In many ways, the crew didn&#39;t fit in, not in the emporium, and not into any category of creature I understood.</p>\n\n<p>Stepping away from the group, not a goodbye was offered. They kept about their busy work, arranging and sorting. I faded into the crowd. Peering into the nearby cases, browsing tables and racks of goods. I imagined what it must be like to have such a life. The imperial elite, noblemen buying beautiful jewels for their wives, or lovers. Starlit dinners overlooking the city below. The scented air, the polished surfaces, the fine booze.</p>\n\n<p>My daydream was interrupted by a tall, lean human. &quot;Chútock! How the hell are you ya&#39; old fox?&quot; He approached the captain with an outstretched hand. I would come to know this man by the name Dusty Hammond.</p>\n\n<p>Intrigued, I work my way back toward the reef dwellers area, listening in.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Always a pleasure.&quot; The captain flatly replied, lifting his snout to look at the man, he sounded less than enthused.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hey, Cap&#39; you wouldn&#39;t have a control armature set. You know, with the old-style decoder?&quot; Dusty asks while eying the table. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let me guess. <em>Normandie</em>&#39;s control lines are disintegrated. Again.&quot; The pointy-eared captain asks without looking up from the table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Nah. Just... looking...&quot; He chuckles. &quot;For you know... spares?&quot; Dusty trails off, trying to brush off the fact that yes, firefights with the empire disintegrate parts of your ship. And no, there is no reason to have &quot;spares&quot; unless they have disintegrated.</p>\n\n<p>He picks up a thick brass tube-like item from the table. This was not a control armature. Dusty looks at the thing and rotates it to stare down the barrel of it. </p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t all the way back at the table yet. &quot;You need a three-phase or four?&quot; I asked him, yelling a bit to fight the sound of the crowd.</p>\n\n<p>With a surprise on his face. &quot;Four. I think.&quot; He responded. Dusty couldn&#39;t quite see me, so he shifted a bit to make eye contact looking through the crowd.</p>\n\n<p>I reached my hand between two customers and plucked a chunky pipe off the table. Handing it to him, the sensor cable dangled from a nub where it was still attached.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here,&quot; I say, plunking it into his hand. &quot;You probably want to get a new encoder, too.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Uh. Thanks.&quot; He says and cocks his head slightly and asks, &quot;Who–who are you again?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s Amal. Amal, meet Dusty.&quot; Chútock said, again without looking up. &quot;Found her in the murkreef. We thought she was dead.&quot; The captain flipped over an item on the table, and arranged it to match the others before finishing his sentence, &quot;She sure did surprise us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The reef? Victoria reef?&quot; Dusty asked us both, his eyes wide.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;Precisely.&quot; I continue, smiling as if everyone should know. &quot;I was working breakers with a crew out of Baysia,&quot; I responded, reminding myself of <em>Grace</em>, Greem and the mess I&#39;m about to be in when he finds me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So...&quot; He started almost too excited, &quot;Find anything good out there?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>I did find something good out there. It would be a bad idea to tell anyone. Very bad. Oh, and I have no idea if the vault was opened, or emptied, or if the breakers found it, or if it&#39;s still floating in an ancient, and most certainly haunted, pirate ship.</p>\n\n<p>It would be best not to let on. &quot;A whole lot of nothing,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>Chútock looks up. Catching my gaze, he continues his work.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah. Nobody ever does.&quot; Dusty said and paused for a moment. &quot;Well. Thanks.&quot; He held up the part. &quot;See you around?&quot; He steps away from the table and offers a charming goodbye. &quot;Captain. Give the misses my best.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Chútock offers no response. The table was surrounded with people rooting through the items, pushing me further toward the exit. I turned and walked through the door into the main hall. It got busier, more crowded. The sound of commerce echoed through the emporium. I left through the main entrance, near a large lobby-like area that led to the clock tower square.</p>\n\n<p>The tan-colored stone clock tower was calibrated for Oryilian time. Therefore it&#39;s sixteen-sided face held 49 hours, also known as &quot;Gesh.&quot; These periods are divided into four quarters and given names in Perseid. Although I could not read the names of the quadrants, I could read the clock itself. Mid-cycle it said, as I felt a twinge of hunger.</p>\n\n<p>I had been to Breehl only a handful of times before, mostly to deal with getting parts for Greem&#39;s oldest ships. On some of my first trips, I quickly discovered Breehl street food was cheap and plentiful with Orylian crab with noodles being a favorite of mine. The blue-green crab would be first be steamed, declawed, and halved. Topped with a citrus-like fruit called Lanka, the green crab would be placed on a pile of buttery noodles and served steaming hot. This was not a typical dish in other parts of the Orlyia Tetrad, nor other parts of Port Bethany. This was a Breehl specialty, and I decided to get some.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>An old woman with thick glasses, an olive complexion and tied back hair was stirring a pot at a noodle stand. There was no line, and her stall was clean and ready. I assumed she only spoke Perseid, so I made the gesture for &quot;one&quot; with my finger. She peered at me through her goggles for a moment, until a flurry of activity began on her workspace. With a hot splash, the noodles were dunked into a large bubbling pot. In an instant, she had the hot fresh crab splayed on her cutting board. Three solid whacks of her broad blade and the crab was in four pieces. It went into a seasoning bowl, and just as fast, it was out again and onto the hot noodles. With a smile, she plated the food in a flat metal dish and handed me a noodle spoon.</p>\n\n<p>I stood near her simple stand and ate. Overeager to eat the succulent crab meat I burned the tips of my index finger and thumb. The nibbles that reached my lips were juicy. I picked at the noodles a bit with the pointed spoon until the crab was cold enough for me to extract the flesh. With a small amount of pressure, I crunched the cartilage of one of the crab halves. It&#39;s bright flesh squeezed out onto the noodles, I and took a fat bite.</p>\n\n<p>It was absolutely delicious. Like a warm, fatty seafood salad. The spongy noodles soaked up the sauce until they were nearly indistinguishable from one another. The Lanka on the crab was fresh and bright, a perfect compliment to the rich butter. I devoured the entire dish.</p>\n\n<p>When it was all over, I returned the plate and paid the woman. Upon taking the money, she mumbled something in Perseid and bowed slightly before returning four smaller coins to me. </p>\n\n<p>Later, I&#39;d come to learn the crab was raised and harvested on station. Somewhere within the water storage tanks and sewage systems, there was a small crab farm. It was illegal, but so commonplace that the local constabulary didn&#39;t do anything about it. I supposed this was the &quot;secret&quot; to the crisp, fresh flavor. Even after learning this, I continued to eat the crab. It was just that good.</p>\n\n<p>I stuffed the coins into my dress pocket. With my hand in there, I felt the entirety of my possessions: four coins, and a single old bullet. Not only did I have almost nothing, I still had to tell Greem what happened. My only hope is <em>they</em> found something — anything on the wreck that would make up for the losses. I</p>\n\n<p>My hands twiddled the bullet and coins in my pocket. I walked past the clock tower and went deeper into Breehl. I thought, If I was going to get home, I needed to get passage back to Baysia. There might be a captain looking for a deckhand — one who&#39;s willing to trade. I could barter my skills for a seat aboard any one of the many passenger ships frequenting this port.</p>\n\n<p>Between the clock tower and the old elevator complex was a small residential district. It was the quietest part of Breehl. There were a few alehouses, cabarets, but it was mostly old homes and essential services for residents. When Licor Scoma was young and rising to power, this is the neighborhood where he lived. It&#39;s the oldest part of the city.</p>\n\n<p>While walking, I heard a voice calling my name. It was emanating from a small saloon past the clock tower. Its windows were open to the street, and its inside was dark and dingy. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal!&quot; a man&#39;s voice called once from inside.</p>\n\n<p>The narrow street wasn&#39;t well lit, even during the day cycle. I stopped to look, and Dusty Hammond stepped from the door. He waved me over.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I want you to meet someone.&quot; He said as I came closer.</p>\n\n<p>I entered the saloon. Dusty and a thin woman were sitting at a narrow table facing the window. On the bar was the coolant condenser I picked out for him, as well as two dark and nearly finished foamy beverages. The woman had short hair, dark skin, and a wide smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Acho.&quot; The woman says hello in Athylian, while her accent told me this was not her native language.<br/></p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is Sevrea, ships engineering. And.. all around handy person?&quot; Dusty half asked.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea nodded at me. With a thick accent, she asked, &quot;Interesting. I hear you were in the reefs. Did you find much?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I chuckled. &quot;No. No, I did not.&quot; I said, feeling as though everyone has been asking me this. It would be better to ask the reef dwellers that saved my life.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. I hear not many have luck there.&quot; Sevrea said slowly in my language.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded. She turned to Dusty, and they conversed for a moment in Perseid. He gave her instructions of some kind, and she gestured her understanding. After talking for a moment, she collected her things and prepared to depart.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I must be going. Nice to have met you.&quot; She said. I offer a low wave, and she&#39;s gone. Through the door and donning a cap and onto the street with the equipment in her hand. Sensor cable still dangling.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thanks again helping find that. Sev can&#39;t always be around, you know? And Chútock. You never know what he&#39;s thinking.&quot; Dusty said. His tone was friendly and warm. &quot;How about a drink?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is nothing, really,&quot; I say, as I walked toward the bar, sit next to him.</p>\n\n<p>We were alone in the saloon except for a young boy working the bar in the back. Dusty snapped one time loudly and pointed at me. The boy offered a hurried nod and began shuffling bottles around looking for something to pour. Judging by the amount of clanking, there didn&#39;t seem to be much.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So. Now that you have a second chance, what&#39;s next?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>I sighed. Shaking my head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I said. &quot;I have to get back to Baysia.&quot; I was interrupted by our young bartender approaching from behind.</p>\n\n<p>If the beverage the boy had brought was alcoholic, he had poured entirely too much. He set the drink in front of me. It was dark red and thick. I decided to wait to sip it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But–&quot;I almost finished my thought. The thought of not having enough money to get back. The thought that even if I did have enough money, I surely wouldn&#39;t have a job, or worse. Greem didn&#39;t have a strong track record of kindness.</p>\n\n<p>I broke. I was tired of thinking about it. I needed something else, a distraction. &quot;Tell me about you,&quot; I said, offering an intentionally open-ended question. I used this ploy with the hopes of having some uninterrupted Perseid style drinking time.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Me?&quot; Dusty thought for a second. His dark eyes peered out the window in front of us. Several people passed under the warm artificial lights. The lighting system of Breehl was attached to fixtures placed high above on the dome structure. During the day cycle, and with the lights on, it was almost like daylight. <em>Almost</em>.</p>\n\n<p>After thinking for a moment, and while touching his chin, he said: &quot;Let me tell you about my ship.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty was poetic in describing <em>Normandie Place</em>. He mused about its quirks. It&#39;s speed. It&#39;s reliability and the lack thereof. While I sipped the red, fruity beverage, he told stories of her crew, her age, and her encounters with the Athylian empire.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As for Athylia? They don&#39;t like me.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>After swallowing, &quot;And why might that be Captain?&quot; I asked, mocking his likability.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;To be honest, they don&#39;t like <em>this</em> place. It scares them, Amal.&quot; He stopped to nod and point up, meaning Port Bethany. &quot;And they don&#39;t like who runs it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My uncle.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I see.&quot; I took a sip. Gathering my thoughts, I tried to decide how I felt about someone related to the Scoma family. On the one hand, I was terrified of the Scoma family. They were a powerful and cruel mob that ran one of the biggest free ports in the galaxy. On the other, that meant Dusty might have had a deep set of interpersonal connections. Something that could be useful if Greem decided he wants payback from the destruction of <em>Havre de Grace</em>. Even if it wasn&#39;t my fault.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Friend,&quot; I said, as I leaned back slightly to access the pocket in my day dress. &quot;You may be of help.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I pulled the bullet out of my pocket and placed it on the bar, flat side down. &quot;Do you know someone who could tell me what this is worth?&quot; I asked. I was confident he would know someone.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty reached forward with a quizzical look on his face. The bullet was longer than standard imperial ammunition. That, and made of hardened scoret and it&#39;s masterfully etched. He pulled it close, and turned it in his hands, reflecting the design in the warm light pouring into the front of the bar.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal.&quot; He whispered. His eyes were fixated on the golden bullet casing. &quot;Amal.&quot; He repeated my name; this time, there was a twinge of fear in his voice.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked. &quot;What do you see?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where did you find this?&quot; His tone had turned serious, and he looked me in the eyes.</p>\n\n<p>I paused. Not sure what to say. He knew exactly where I found it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The reef? Did you find this in the Victoria reef?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded slowly and explained further. &quot;I came upon a derelict cruiser, and this was stowed aboard.&quot; I was careful here not to reveal the vault. &quot;I was alone, and I fell. The reef dwellers saved me. This was all I was able to...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal I need to know exactly where that ship is.&quot; He said in dead seriousness.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why? What is this thing?&quot; I pleaded for more information.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Do you know the legend of <em>Reason to Believe</em>?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where&#39;s the pistol? Did you see it? It must be there.&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The pistol? I haven&#39;t any idea.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s got to be on that ship. It&#39;s got to be somewhere on it.&quot; He said while making a fist motion on the table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This must be valuable,&quot; I say, connecting my thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>He laughed. &quot;Yes.&quot; Quieter, and with squinting eyes, he continues. &quot;Some say. It might also even...&quot; He paused for dramatic effect &quot;...be cursed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Cursed?&quot; I responded to him with a raised eyebrow, and a tone ripe with skepticism.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Cursed or not, it&#39;s worth a fortune.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How much?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, depends on–&quot;He stopped speaking for a moment. I saw his mind churning over important facts. &quot;Wait. Chútock and his crew at the emporium today.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What of them?&quot; I asked. &quot;They were selling scrap parts, you know, condensers. You bought one. Remember?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No. It all makes sense now.&quot; He said. I couldn&#39;t tell if he was intentionally cryptic or if he was still working out all the pieces in his head. &quot;Leedo. He was at the emporium today. I saw him– we spoke briefly.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Leedo?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Leedo Comstock. A weapons dealer, a friend of my uncles. He deals in very rare and very expensive firearms.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The reason he would be here is if he was purchasing something. Something like–&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Reason to Believe</em>,&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>If the reef dwellers did find something, I knew they didn&#39;t bring it with them to Breehl. There would have been too much of a risk of me seeing it. It had to be on their ship. That meant Ledo wasn&#39;t there to buy, but there to set up the deal. They were talking with the captain, feeling it out.</p>\n\n<p>I was sure Dusty wanted this treasure as much as I did. What would he stop to get it? Would he leverage the power of his family connections if I went after it without him? I feared cutting him out would at best mean not finding the prized weapon. At worst, I wouldn&#39;t leave Breehl alive. I couldn&#39;t take that risk.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I know where it is.&quot; I say, &quot;We&#39;ll have to act fast.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty&#39;s eyes were wide open. &quot;We? What?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s in that ship, Dusty. And we&#39;re going find it.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>5</h1>\n\n<p>&quot;After you,&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>The crew of the reef dwellers ship was in Breehl trading and resupplying when Dusty Hammond and I arrived at the empty dock way. It was the middle of the port&#39;s day cycle, a slow time for arrivals and departures.</p>\n\n<p>The ship had several cargo derricks attached to the dock way, via large cargo doors. We snuck in through an open bay. Passing piles of crates and scrap, we reached one of the main passageways of the reef dwellers cluttered ship.</p>\n\n<p>Whispering &quot;This way.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>We traversed the disheveled ship. It&#39;s dim halls hummed, its leaky pipes steamed and sputtered. The scrap and debris created a canyon towards the crew berthings. We passed the cargo area with the imperial clothing container, and I knew we&#39;re on the right path.</p>\n\n<p>From my time aboard the vessel, I got a good sense of the layout from the stellar anchor to the ship&#39;s mess area and engineering to the berthings and staterooms. There was only a handful of places I haven&#39;t been. One of those was the upper storage bays, nearest the officer&#39;s residencies.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Up here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty followed me up a tight set of stairs. We were taking three to four steps at a time due to them being designed for much smaller creatures. The top of stairway opened into a small narrow hall that was surprising free of clutter. We systematically opened each of the metal doors and peeking inside each room. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal,&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>I walked to Dusty and the door he had opened. There in the middle of the empty room sat the vault of <em>Leviathan</em>. It had been removed in its entirety from the wreck. The door panel had its wires exposed and rigged to a panel across the room. The keypad was illuminated. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is this?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s... a long story,&quot; I said, approaching the vault.</p>\n\n<p>I ran my hands along the vault door. It was sitting not quite level on the floor. It&#39;s base sat unevenly due to careless cutting. The reef dwellers had removed it from the beast, precisely like they surgically separated <em>Grace</em> into pieces. I was amazed they had gotten it into this room until I realized the far wall was a wide door in and of itself. The panel rigged up to the vault must have been the external door controls.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Can you open it?&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. Yes, I can.&quot; I replied and approached the vault.</p>\n\n<p>The key code vividly returned to my memory, along with many others of that day. What trap lay for me this time? I thought for a moment. It actually <em>could</em> be cursed.</p>\n\n<p>I entered the key code, and the light above the keypad illuminated a brilliant green, just as it did that day.</p>\n\n<p>The vault door opened silently. Slowly at first, then faster sliding and revealing a brilliant golden lit chamber no bigger than the stall I purchased crab noodles at earlier in the cycle. Inside were shelves, filled with martial weaponry. Swords, pikes, and knives. Each golden, silver and had ornate inlays. These had to be worth a lot. A whole lot. I climbed into the room and entered the yellowish light. </p>\n\n<p>In the center of the chamber sat a golden box emblazoned with a two-headed falcon carrying a sword in its talons. I would later learn this was the emblem of the Royal Acolyte.</p>\n\n<p>Lifting the lid of the box I found the ancient weapon laying on its side.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Is it there?&quot; Dusty asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s here.&quot; I was in awe. My eyes locked, scanning the gruesome design. For a moment, I could have sworn I heard a voice. A whisper on the wind. I couldn&#39;t be sure though.</p>\n\n<p>The thing was twice as heavy as I expected, but handled beautifully. As if I had used this weapon my entire life, I smoothly opened, checked the cylinder. It was loaded, seven rounds. They were shorter than the cylinder itself, and they didn&#39;t look at all like the one in my pocket.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I have it,&quot; I said, snapping out of my trance. I walked backward out of the chamber out of the yellow light and back into reality.</p>\n\n<p>A gunshot clanged from the entrance of the room as a fox-like creature yelled and barked before wildly unloading two more at Dusty, and I. Lethal bullets bounced around the large room, let from the reef dwellers meager weaponry. I took cover behind the vault as Dusty pulled a handgun. He <em>was</em> armed, and he returned fire, blowing a hole in the bulkhead near the yelping creature.</p>\n\n<p>I heard several more shots. &quot;Amal,&quot; Dusty stated the obvious over the ringing in my ears. &quot;Time to go!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty and I emerged from the vault room and searched for the creature who attacked us. Nothing left, nothing right. It was gone, lost amid the pipework and debris of the hall.</p>\n\n<p>We hurried down the tight staircase and onto the main level of the ship. A klaxon rang out. The creature must have sounded the general alarm. A voice squawked and barked over the crackling intercom.</p>\n\n<p>I was rushing down a cluttered hall when two angry crew members confronted us. They spotted us but took a moment to aim. Dusty fumbled with his weapon. He was caught off guard. Before the assailants could sight us in, they were dead. My gun tore through them, slinging them each into the clutter that lined bulkhead. My ears were ringing as I looked at my outstretched arm and smoking weapon. I was surprised by my newfound instinctual ability to end lives. It was terrifying and powerful.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty offered me a thankful look and a nod. He knew he would have been killed had I not, had the weapon not, have acted first.</p>\n\n<p>The ship was a maze of clutter and debris. Pressing forward, found our way to the main airlock without encountering any more reef dwellers. Once onto the dock way I used the docking connector controls to seal the airlock and shut the cargo doors. I pulled the fire alarm. With a hiss and clank, the port&#39;s fire protection procedure sealed the ship from the rest of the port.</p>\n\n<p>Out of breath, Dusty hunched over as we ran.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on.&quot; I grabbed him and propelled him forward down the dock way as he stumbled for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>Crossing the dock way we made it to the far end of the market district. Our pace slowed as we attempted to match the behavior of the busy traders and shoppers. Dusty caught his breath and alerted me that my weapon was not concealed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You might want to hide that.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;In here. Quick.&quot; I grabbed him, and we darted off the street.</p>\n\n<p>We slipped into the first clothing shop we could find. It wasn&#39;t far. Once inside, we tried to repress our heavy breathing. If we looked like we had just run from a gunfight, it was because we had. </p>\n\n<p>A bell attached to the door of the quiet shop jingled. It alerted the shopkeeper of our presence, but he made no motion to greet us. The shop was packed with shelves of heavy clothing and racks of coats and hats. These were needed on station due to the icy night cycles when the on station heaters power down.</p>\n\n<p>The small shop keeper stayed in the back of the place. A radio played a Perseid language news program. We tried to browse casually while occasionally checking through the windows of the place. Through the racks of cloaks and overcoats, I selected one with large inner pockets and high collar. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ten marks.&quot; The old shopkeeper said. He looked at my fine day dress, waistband and all. I must have appeared more wealthy than his average customer. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ten? Friend, it&#39;s worth three at most.&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe I was haggling at a time like this, but I didn&#39;t have the money.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ten.&quot; He leaned over to check on the only other patron of his shop and saw Dusty Hammond. The shopkeep paused for a moment and adjusted his glasses. The radio droned on.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll give it to you for four marks.&quot; I feigned a smile. He either recognized a nephew of the Scoma family patriarch, or my womanly charm had wooed him. The shopkeep motioned for the money. After the exchange, we were off.</p>\n\n<p>Armed with a greater sense of safety, Dusty and I walked deeper into the bustling market district.<br/></p>\n\n<p>&quot;What now?&quot; I ask while checking over my shoulder into the throng of shoppers and merchants. All clear.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ll visit my uncle. It&#39;s safe there, and he&#39;ll be able to help you get off port.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at him. There was no choice for me, but to enter the belly of the beast.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The Scoma family residence is an old narrow, white home with dark shutters. It was on a clean street not far from the saloon I met Dusty.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty sprang up the short stoop and approached the dark-colored door. He rang the bell, and a man in a suit opened it wide.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mr. Hammond.&quot; He said. I looked at the man from my position standing on the street. &quot;And a guest?&quot; He asks, pointing at me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah. Amal. You&#39;ll like her.&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>The suited man waved us in, and we entered the great room of an elegant residence. It was well decorated with tall windows. In the center were four men seated in couches around a small table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Uncle Franco,&quot; Dusty said with a smile greeting his older relative. </p>\n\n<p>Scoma turned to look. His eyes lit up with joy. &quot;Gallichio, It is good to see you, my boy. How is your father?&quot; Scoma said. His voice sounded old and authoritative.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He&#39;s well. Sends his love, of course.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>We had interrupted the men having tea. Scoma offered a welcoming gesture for us to enter. This felt like the sort of place that’s expected to offer a traditional Athylian <em>Bochah</em> tea ceremony. Although with one look at Dusty and I, they decided to forgo any and all formalities.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ledo, you remember my nephew, Dustaph,&quot; Scoma said to the arms dealer who was sitting in an expensive looking chair near the window.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. We spoke this morning at Drapeta market.&quot; Ledo said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And who&#39;s this?&quot; Scoma gestured to me.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dusty could introduce me, I introduced myself. &quot;Amal,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She&#39;s a friend of mine.&quot; Said, Dusty.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come. Sit.&quot; Scoma said. We took our places on an empty couch facing Ledo and what I assumed was his guard.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Enough business Ledo. We can finish this later. I trust you&#39;ll make the right choice. Mind you. They are not to be trusted.&quot; Scoma said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Ledo said. He took a sip from his ornate tea cup, and settled back.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So what brings you two here?&quot; Scoma asked.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty had his elbows on his knees, his hands folded in front of his mouth with fingers placed against his lips. He locked eyes with his uncle, pausing to consider his next words. </p>\n\n<p>Before we could respond, a man brought more tea. Two cups and hot kettle on an elegant tea tray were placed on the table in front of us. On the tray sat two types of dried and bagged tea. <em>Red Olata</em> and another I was less familiar with but assumed it was a non-psychoactive option. It’s customary to offer both.</p>\n\n<p>We pause for a moment to let the man leave. Dusty clears his throat. &quot;Amal seeks safe passage to Baysia.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>His uncle looked me over, no doubt wondering what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My lord, I owe debts to the creature Greem,&quot; I said. &quot;And those debts are my own to repay. I will surely repay you. You have my word.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Scoma said. &quot;Baysia. Yes, I know of it.&quot; He paused, thought for a moment, and turned to Dusty. &quot;Tell you what. Nephew, <em>you</em> take her. I will ensure your passage. But I must ask one favor of you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Anything, uncle.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Follow the spinward route. Take Foley&#39;s passage. So to avoid the murkreef that at the shores of Baysia. It has become dangerous as of late. The creatures that dwell there are emboldened and unchallenged.&quot; His seriousness turned warm. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want anything to happen to you. Either of you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To me, Scoma looked like a grandfather. He was kind, and spoke with the gentle wisdom that I imagine most grandfathers have.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very well, uncle,&quot; Dusty said. &quot;We shall leave this cycle.&quot; Dusty spoke formally with his uncle</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Be safe,&quot; Scoma said while Leedo sipped his tea and his guard looked on.</p>\n\n<p>We said our farewells and headed to the small ship landing platform where <em>Normandie Place</em> was fueled and ready to depart.</p>\n\n<p>A familiar figure was atop the wing of <em>Normandie</em> when we entered the bay. Wearing a welding mask blue sparks flew from an opened panel she was working on. The ship had two great wings attached to a narrow fuselage.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea yelled a Perseid command and leaned back with her head turned. The thing whined, clicked and belched a black plume of smoke from the aft rocket bells. The dynamo audibly strained. It sounded as if each muscle in <em>Normandie</em>&#39;s body ached. Sevrea called out as if to say, &quot;A little more.&quot; The smoke dissipated into the hanger.</p>\n\n<p><em>Normandie</em>&#39;s engines shut down, and Sevrea shot us a wave from her perch. We walked closer — a patchwork of repairs along the body of the craft laid on its skin like scars. The thickest part of each wing held two turret cannons. Their muzzles protruded from under the wings edge. This was a warship. She looked small, fast, and armed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;ll hold,&quot; Sevrea said in her accent. &quot;For now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sevrea, you remember Amal,&quot; Dusty said gesturing to me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course. Riding with us?&quot; She asks. Her uniform and hands were blackened from the grease and oil of the craft. A soot mark had been smeared across her forehead. She seemed smart and capable, something that didn&#39;t readily strike me about her captain.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea spoke to Dusty, &quot;I&#39;ll need to finish the repairs on the bulwark. The condenser valve you found needed a new sensor.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I knew that.</p>\n\n<p>We entered <em>Normandie Place</em> though the aft cargo entrance below the four engines. It was a small ship, cramped and lived in. There was one narrow passage connecting each room in a long main passageway. Dusty showed me around. His tour included the galley and the mess, six individual berthings, and the bridge that seated five, and the small engineering and medical bay.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is all this for?&quot; I asked. We were standing in what was to be my quarters. A small cot sat along the windowless wall. The accommodations were sparse.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Adventures, of course.&quot; He said. He was leaning in the frame of the doorway. He was charming. I could tell he was proud of this ship, and more comfortable on board than not.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Adventures?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, yes. You know, battling the empire. Treasure hunting.&quot; He stepped closer to me. &quot;Saving princesses.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s get one thing straight. You <em>did not</em> save me. And I am no princess.&quot; I put him in his place. &quot;But, this has been an adventure, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot; And he gave a little.</p>\n\n<p>I had nearly forgotten the ancient weapon hiding in my cloak. Removing my jacket, I set it on the small desk that was bolted to the wall near the bed. I caught him eying my outfit. His eyes wandered from my head to toes. I frowned. It wasn&#39;t truly a frown, more of a squint.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll see to it that Sev helps you get settled in.&quot; He said, pointing upward. The clanging continued.</p>\n\n<p>He must have been accustomed to having guests. After all, there was hardly any raw cargo space aboard. What else would they carry?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;By the way, we&#39;re going to have to make a quick stop before Baysia.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;An old dive. We can lay low there for a few cycles, catch a break and let things cool off.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot; I smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty cleared his throat. &quot;I will leave you to it, then. I&#39;ll be in the galley. We&#39;ll set out once the repairs are complete.&quot; Dusty turned and left. His footsteps disappeared down the hall.</p>\n\n<p>I laid back on the tiny bed in my room. It groaned as it springs stretched. There I listened to the sound of Sevrea hammering while staring at the featureless ceiling. I closed my eyes slowly and let them remain closed. I need a moment to process all that was happening.</p>\n\n<p>Coming here. Risking so much. Everything. What had happened to good old fashioned <em>don&#39;t ask any questions</em> cargo hauling?</p>\n\n<p>This was not the life I thought I would live.</p>\n\n<p>I drifted off to sleep.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I awoke to a knock on the metal door.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Acho? Amal?&quot; Sevrea poked her head into the doorway.</p>\n\n<p>I had curled a scratchy green blanket around my body during my sleep. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh. Come in Sevrea.&quot; I said, my eyes heavy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hammond said you might you want some dinner?&quot; She entered the room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. I think that would be nice.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I sat up. She placed a stack of clean linens on the edge of the bed. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re eating in the mess. Down the hall.&quot; Her words came enveloped in a soft Perseid accent.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Have we taken off?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, we&#39;re well underway.&quot; She replied.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded, looking around the room a bit while stretching.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea exited as quiet as she entered, leaving the door open. The murmur of Dusty and other voices echoed in the hall. As I left my room, the smell of hot food wafted to my nose, waking me up. I yawned and grew hungry.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty was mid-joke as I entered &quot;...So I said, no <em>you</em> eat it!&quot; The room laughed, and I winced from the brightness of the overhead lights.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, Amal. Have a seat.&quot; He beckoned me to the only empty chair at the small round table.</p>\n\n<p>I sat to find two new faces, along with the two familiar ones. Sevrea stood up to get me a plate, leaving me with Dusty and the two new crew members.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal. Meet Jin Tail.&quot; He pointed to my left to an older man with dark brown eyes, dark skin, and almost no hair. &quot;Tactical Officer. Part-time ships cook. Deadly in the kitchen. Doesn&#39;t talk much though.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Jin watched Dusty describe him while chewing.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And our first mate, Olen Abeona. Ships navigator, pilot.&quot; He pointed to my right at a woman with black, tied back hair. She had honey colored skin, and large, dark eyes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Welcome aboard.&quot; She said in an accent I couldn’t place.</p>\n\n<p>A plate steaming Greenwich Ham and with a side of Oryilian witloof appeared in front of me. Greenwich ham is unsophisticated and traditional. A favorite old naval recipe consisting of preserved spig chops, salted and boiled. The natural gelatin of the meat is extracted from the boiling liquid and is then combined with tomatoes to make a sweet jelly that is served on top the meat. It is good and salty and a simple dish. Not meant to be fancy, but it fills you up.</p>\n\n<p>After serving, Sevrea sat across from me, between Dusty and Olen. Tempted by the aroma, I dug into the tender meat, spreading a bit of the luscious red jelly atop. I savored this first bite. It was perfectly tender, salty, and a tad sweet. Jin had outdone himself.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So where are we?&quot; I asked aloud after a few bites, hoping to spur the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Headed rimward, that is, <em>away</em> from the core of the galaxy,&quot; Olen explained to me. &quot;But we&#39;re still ways out from Ornus.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ornus Mining Complex. It&#39;ll be a good place to lay low. Like I said earlier. Quick stop before we head up to Baysia.&quot; Dusty jumped in.</p>\n\n<p>He was right. The reef dwellers would be looking for me. I needed to let things cool off, at least for a little while. For how long I wondered? I had no idea. I supposed I&#39;m better off alive though.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Been around forever. Even longer than Port Bethany. Not much <em>mining</em> going on there lately, though.&quot; He finishes with smirk.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mining?&quot; I said. &quot;I grew up on the mines of Tau Ogma.&quot; Offering a bit of personal history. &quot;Awful place.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well.&quot; Dusty stopped eating to speak. Something changed in his demeanor. &quot;Makes sense.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked. I wondered if I had offended him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Tau Ogma. Your clothes.&quot; He pointed. &quot;Everything. It all makes sense.&quot; The others at the table looked at me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t follow,&quot; I said, shaking my head as I swallowed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You don&#39;t?&quot; He chuckles. &quot;Then let me fill you in. Your <em>king</em> has been reaching his foul hands into Breehl as of late. Intimidating merchants, double-dealing, smearing the Scoma name. There&#39;s even a garrison down on Orlop street now. So pardon me if it all makes too much sense that an imperial is now aboard my ship.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>My entire life, I had never thought of myself as an Athylian subject. Although, technically, I was. The moon of Tau Ogma was imperial territory, and my mother had given birth to me there. Brought there by the empire, saved from a derelict vessel. She may have been in debt to the empire, but she did not have its blood in her veins, and neither did I.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Imperial? What are you talking about? Have I offended you?&quot; I pleaded.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The mines. Those clothes.&quot; He turned to the group. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you know it? We&#39;ve got a daughter of the Athylian Empire, right here on our ship.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No. You don&#39;t understand.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Easy Dusty,&quot; Sevrea said. &quot;It&#39;s not like she&#39;s one of them. You know that.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Do I Sevrea? Tell me, where did she get those clothes?&quot; He said, still pointing.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;These aren&#39;t mine. Chútock offered them to me. And he stole them.&quot; I said. I took an exasperated pause. &quot;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, do you? You think we&#39;re all the same. We&#39;re all, ‘Close your eyes and think of Athylia&#39;, huh?&quot; My face narrowed, focusing tight on him. &quot;Those mines were terrible, wretched places. Do you think we had a <em>choice</em>? Do you think we <em>wanted</em> die in those pits? Make no mistake. I hate the empire as much as you do.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The tenseness wrought silence at the table. Jin chewed away.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Athylian or not, instead of attacking her, you should be thanking her for helping us find that part we needed,&quot; Sevrea said. &quot;Thank you, Amal. Also, don&#39;t mind our Captain. He&#39;s a bit touchy after our latest encounter with that kingship.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I turned from Sevrea, looked at Dusty, and he left my gaze.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, thanks, Jinny. I&#39;ve got some charting to do. Don&#39;t want to get caught in a storm.&quot; Olen popped up from the table. Jin didn&#39;t acknowledge until she had left the room, and when he did, it was merely a grunt.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I hate it when she calls me that.&quot; He said in a deep voice.</p>\n\n<p>Low, uncomfortable laughter emitted from the group. We tried to move on from the tension of the earlier conversation.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I was laying on my cot. I had unloaded <em>Reason to Believe</em>, and was trying to tell if it, in fact, was the great weapon of lore and legend. I debated in my head what I had found. It gleamed and reflected my face in the hard, white light of the room. I turned it over, and the etched design on its side drew me in. Animals were hunting their prey. Bloodthirsty, pursuing <em>something</em> into the jungle. What did it mean?</p>\n\n<p>A knock emitted from the door to my cabin. I thought it was Sevrea. To my surprise, Dusty entered.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You seemed pretty handy. Sev needs help in engineering.&quot; He said tersely. Dusty made no mention of what happened at dinner. Maybe I had been expecting an apology. But on the other hand, perhaps he was on edge. The empire has a way of doing that.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked. Leaning forward, I set the weapon down at the edge of the bed.</p>\n\n<p>He shrugged. We were silent. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking of his comments during the ship&#39;s meal.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;About earlier.&quot; He said. &quot;Amal. I...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s alright. Seems like everyone&#39;s on edge lately.&quot; I empathized with him.</p>\n\n<p>He moved from the frame of the door and into the room. Closer, he sat on the side of the cot near my head. I sat up, abrasive green blanket over my legs. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;You know I&#39;m not like them, right?&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know much about you. All I know is that you&#39;re someone, unlike anyone I&#39;ve met.&quot; He said. His eyes transfixed upon the weapon at the foot of the cot.</p>\n\n<p>After a moment, he looked at me. &quot;And I know you&#39;re tough.&quot; He smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty leaned against the wall beside me.</p>\n\n<p>I turned to look at him, careful not to face him. His eyes were looking down. I then leaned forward and picked up my sidearm. It gleamed in the light.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You think it&#39;s it? <em>Reason to Believe</em>&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>He nodded slowly. I didn&#39;t trust him, not after what he said at dinner. I put the weapon down again. Wondering why he&#39;d come.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wanted to apologize.&quot; He said, almost as if I&#39;d asked him outright.</p>\n\n<p>We weren&#39;t facing each other, but our foreheads touched. I was fine with that. I welcomed the sense of affection and savored that quiet moment. I rested my head on his shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The intimacy of our touch made me feel delicate. I could feel every subtle change in his body, every breath. I could hear his heart. I was too close.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wanted you to know that under the circumstances, if you needed an ear, I&#39;m here.&quot; He sat up slightly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Then his lips met mine. For a second, I thought I would let myself enjoy the pleasure this kiss. But I didn&#39;t trust him, I didn&#39;t know the real him. Maybe I was overreacting about what he said, but something felt off.</p>\n\n<p>I pulled away gently. &quot;No.&quot; I whispered. I cleared my throat. &quot;Forgive me.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>His eyes darted away from mine. I turned away.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.&quot; I mumbled.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal. I...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Dusty.&quot; I whispered.</p>\n\n<p>We sat in silence. The seconds ticked by, slowly, cumbersome with anticipation and uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>Static over the intercom system. &quot;Captain. Report to the bridge. Got some weather coming in.&quot; Olen&#39;s voice over the intercom announced.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty cleared his throat. &quot;I should go.&quot; He left.</p>\n\n<p>I sighed as his footsteps retreated. I grabbed my sidearm and walked through hatch towards engineering to find Sevrea.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Through the single passageway the ship I found myself where the howl of the propulsion dynamos was the loudest. By the sound of things, we were well underway. Ducking through a low hanging hatch, I entered a wide, triangular room that sat under one of the wings.</p>\n\n<p>There, I found Sevrea. She had several access panels removed and was standing head deep in a narrow service compartment. Her toolbox sat nearby, nestled in a nest of multicolored wiring and specialized tools. A soiled hand-stretched from inside the hole and tossed a wrench onto the deck near the toolbox.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sevrea?&quot; I asked loudly.</p>\n\n<p>A head sprouted from the service compartment. She had been re-greased, her face and arms splotched with soot.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hammond says you know your way around starships.&quot; She said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I do. Older ones I&#39;m afraid. Pre-war and the like.&quot; I rubbed the wall closest to entrance to the room, trying to gauge the age of this ship.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;ll do. See if you can&#39;t hop down here align this diverter. I can&#39;t seem to get it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I approached the lower service compartment and looked down at Sevrea, standing in the hole. Dirty, with her hair tied back she was up to her elbows in starship grease. I offered her my hand while getting out. She grabbed it and cursed in Perseid as she climbed from the compartment. Tugging on me, she lifted herself out.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Takes a lot to throw this out of adjustment. What happened?&quot; I ask.&quot;You can thank our Captain.&quot; She sounded annoyed. &quot;He&#39;s always getting us in one kind of trouble or another. One day the empire is chasing us through asteroid fields or ice floes, the next, we&#39;re taking fire from marauders.&quot; She finished with a sigh.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea squatted then handed me the wrench she tossed out of the machinery filled hole.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here.&quot; She handed over the tool, placing it on the floor near the toolbox and wire nest. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hammond&#39;s not one to care much about the health and safety of his crew. He&#39;s in it for the treasure. Wealth. Fame. Whatever.&quot; She said. &quot;And you know what else? His family encourages him. Who do you think bankrolls this whole operation?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Thinking of her words, I squeezed into a tight service compartment. It was warmer than above. Everything was coated with a film of grease. I felt the vibrations of the engines pulsing through the equipment surrounding me as I tried to analyze the compartment and its hardware.</p>\n\n<p>There was a singe smell to the compartment. Taking in a breath, I realized it was ozone. Faint, but present. Running my fingers over the wiring and tubing surrounding the damaged component, I found the problem. A gearbox encasing a pinion had been jammed open. As I ran my finger along the notches, I found worn spots in the teeth. It would turn out to be an easy thing to fix. I had plenty of other, more complicated problems to worry about anyway.</p>\n\n<p>She leans closer to the hole. &quot;Amal. I saw the way he looked at you. I&#39;d be careful.&quot; Listening while working, I thought about what he wanted, and if I could trust him. If only she knew what had transpired only moments ago in my cabin.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well. Why do you follow him?&quot; I asked, sizing the wrench with my thumb.</p>\n\n<p>She was quiet.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; I asked. &quot;Why do you trust him?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t. But he pays us well. Well enough at least.&quot; She looked up. &quot;This ship has a rotating crew. People don&#39;t stay long aboard <em>Normandie</em>. Not with what we go through. I&#39;ve been here the longest. But, then again this place would fall apart without me, and he knows that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nodded and carefully twisted the wrench. There was a faint groan as the mechanism gave way. Tightening it quelled the vibrations of the dynamo feeders.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That should do it,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>She smiled while offering a hand to help me from the service compartment. Once standing, we both lifted the access panel and placed it over the bay.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea looked at me. &quot;Thanks. I hope we don&#39;t run into anything else.&quot; She said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No. Thank you.&quot; I replied. &quot;For the advice I mean.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She smiled and paused before continuing. &quot;You might want to head to the bridge and get buckled up. Olen said there&#39;s foul weather brewing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I left engineering behind me. The sounds of the power plant grew quiet as I walked forward. The engines were running smoothly. A gentle bank and pitch told me we were entering harsh winds. The ship groaned gently as nebualic waves crashed into the hull.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the bridge sat Olen and Dusty, both looking tense and wearing their headsets. Olen was in the left seat keeping <em>Normandie Place</em> steady. Her hands grasped the controls carefully. She flew with only the tips of her fingers, continually correcting. To her right sat Dusty, fiddling with a set of knobs above the main window.</p>\n\n<p>Above us, lightning split the skies. It streaked overhead like a vernal bolt. Flashes of color broke through the clouds and danced wildly among them. It was beautiful at first, but then it began to grow. The heavens opened up. Rain swirled as we rushed through the tempest. The stars were angry. The deck was awash, swept with a heavy deluge.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Buckle up. We&#39;re in for some chop.&quot; Olen said, without looking at me. She flipped a switch and took the controls with both hands. She faced the water-slicked windscreen, looking away from me. Dusty was watching the weather. Flashes of light lit up his features, contorted from the reflection of the glass.</p>\n\n<p>The wind howled outside of the viewports, which rattled uncomfortably. A massive spiraling structure of purplish-blue and white clouds was forming in the distance. Tendrils of swirling clouds reached from its surface into space. Each passing second drew us closer.</p>\n\n<p>The ship jolted and rattled, tossing me to my right. I grabbed a handhold for support, nearly falling over, then climbed into the seat and fastened the restraints. The cabin grew darker as we flew deeper into the swirling storm. Flashes of white light flickered in the distance. As the light from the outside turned dark purple to black, the lighted bridge panels and instruments grew brighter.</p>\n\n<p>I looked to Olen. She maintained the course, her face a clenched as she focused on the controls. Yet she did not turn.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; I asked in a loud voice. We were now enveloped in clouds.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s her.&quot; Dusty whispered. &quot;She&#39;s here.&quot; He appeared hypnotized by the light show.</p>\n\n<p>I looked forward, catching a glance of the navigation panel. The compass was spinning wildly. Olen did not seem to notice it, or if she did simply chose to ignore its absurdity. Instead, she continued to fly.</p>\n\n<p>Before I could respond, the ship turned violently. A wall of pressure forced me back in the chair. My restraints gripped my shoulders as we collided with the tendrils of clouds. The ship tossed around like a leaf in a whirlwindl, slamming from one side of the storm to the other groaning against the wind.</p>\n\n<p>I looked out the front viewport as we careened off into darkness.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lights! Olen!&quot; Dusty commanded, his brow coated with sweat. Olen turned on the forward navigation lights. A beam of white light illuminated the bluish fog ahead of the ship. We bounced around in our seats as I held onto the navigator&#39;s table.</p>\n\n<p>The engines howled trying to overcome the storm as the buffeting winds strengthened. Olen shifted in her seat, struggling to keep her course steady, she tightened her grip on the controls.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You see it?&quot; She asked Dusty.</p>\n\n<p>He leaned forward, gripping the frame of the window. Swiveling his head about, he searched the storm through the glass of the cockpit.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We <em>should</em> be close.&quot; She said, shaking her head. &quot;Just keep your eyes out.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>More rain arrived, countless raindrops pounded against the glass and hull. We powered through and rattled along. I joined the group in scanning the windowpane, peering into the heart of the storm. I wasn&#39;t sure what we were looking for, but I had a feeling I&#39;d know it if I saw it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Blasted.&quot; Dusty turned to the navigator&#39;s station find a star chart of the region. Still seated, he contorted his body, reaching back to sort through the piles of charts. I made no effort to help and kept my eyes on the storm.</p>\n\n<p>The charts won&#39;t help us through this fog. I&#39;ve navigated the Victoria reef long enough to know it&#39;s no use if you can&#39;t sight stars.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There. What&#39;s that?&quot; I said. Through the clouds and rain, I had caught a glimpse of a faint point of light. &quot;Low. On the starboard side.&quot; The ship turned sharply in the opposite direction, the bridge creaking around us.</p>\n\n<p>Olen angled the craft. The heavy wings dipped as she forced <em>Normandie</em> starboard. A break in the clouds offered another glimpse at the beacon. Its cone-like beam shined through the mist, a guiding signal to wayward spacefarers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Dead ahead!&quot; I exclaimed. The ship quickly turned again. We traveled slower, the engines straining. Lightning flashed and illuminated the fog on the starboard side of the ship.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I see it. Thank gods.&quot; Olen aligned the ship to head for the beacon in the clouds.</p>\n\n<p>We moved aghast through the storm. Winds tossed the ship about wildly as <em>Normandie</em> took us deeper into the darkening storm. The beacon&#39;s light played about us, but the clouds and rain still remained thick.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty breathed a sigh of relief and bounced hard off a swell. Losing his balance, he grabbed the bulkhead handle to his side.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A lighthouse. <em>Three Graves Point</em>.&quot; She paused. &quot;It means we&#39;re close.&quot; She leveled the ship, and pulled the throttle to the aft, turning <em>Normandie</em> to face the misty wall of clouds and wind.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re almost there.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The sounds of the engines became a prolonged, low-pitched whine as we flew forward. Our craft began to lurch back and forth violently as the winds threw <em>Normandie</em> about. We bounced onward, the lighthouse signaling in the distance. Hard rain and ice pelted the metal hull.</p>\n\n<p>Thunder crashed and shook the ship. I tightened my seatbelt further. Dusty leaned forward, resting his arms on the wall in front of the window.</p>\n\n<p>The illuminated beacon grew large before us, but the clouds seemed to thicken and slow. With great trepidation I watched the lamp grow as we approached.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Never have I seen a storm like this,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Stick with us, Amal. You shall see many things.&quot; Olen said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How long until we reach Ornus?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Just beyond the lighthouse. Not long now.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>6</h1>\n\n<p>Dusty sat looking out the forward window of the bridge. His grey eyes fixed to the swirling fog. He hadn&#39;t said anything to me since our encounter earlier. Like the terrific storm shrouding what lies within its eye, he too sat with his secrets.</p>\n\n<p>Past the lighthouse, yellow and white lights shined through the bluish darkness. The glowing points outlined what appeared to be a small mining platform. It sat atop metal cross beams that had been driven into the moon-sized rock it was perched atop. As we got closer, I could see that several layers had been carved from the face of the moon. Like a massive open pit quarry, glistening the light, wet from the driving rain. Each layer showed its art. Tiers of rounded steps, descending down to a bright orange light. It seemed to be the entrance to the mining facility.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Awake?&quot; Dusty spoke aloud.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am,&quot; I spoke back. It had been a few hours since Dusty last spoke directly to me. He watched with his grey eyes fixed, no shift in his gaze, as I got up, walked to the helm and looked out into the darkness of space.</p>\n\n<p>Oddly, there were no mining operations underway. No ships loading with minerals, no workers, no signs of activity at all. I assumed this was because of the storm. I would soon discover was no mining complex at all. Or at least, not anymore.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is the back way. Nobody ever uses it unless they&#39;re...&quot; Dusty stopped and didn&#39;t finish the thought. &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea appeared at the entrance of the bridge. &quot;That wasn&#39;t so bad, huh?&quot; she said, taking an empty seat for landing. Given how violent the ride was, I assume she couldn’t possibly have been aboard for the journey. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where&#39;s Jin?&quot; Dusty asked.</p>\n\n<p>He was concerned, but Sevrea did not share those feelings. She shrugged back at him while adjusting the buckle of her seat.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty clicked on the intercom. &quot;Jin. Need you up here. We&#39;re coming in.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>Through the wind and rain, Olen landed <em>Normandie Place</em> on the main pad of the rig. The landing lights of the craft the beamed onto the platform, lighting the rain and reflecting off the pools of water that had collected on the old pad. With a final bump, we touched down.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Get the hatch open,&quot; Dusty ordered with a tone of fatigue. He was exhausted and unimpressed with the weather. </p>\n\n<p>Olen flipped some switches and the engines spooled down. Without the sound of the turbines, the patter of rainfall became a steady rush of a thousand whispers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This place can get rough.&quot; Dusty broke his silence to me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I can hold my own.&quot; I wouldn&#39;t admit it, but I was genuinely scared. The ride had really shaken me, and I had no idea what to expect next.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty let out a long breath, &quot;Good,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>He nodded and looked past me into the hallway connecting the bridge to the rest of the ship. Jin stood there. and nestled into the pocket of his shoulder was a long automatic rifle with a large magazine. Muzzle pointed skyward, it was an beat-up old thing. Its paint was worn and edges dulled, and it clicked and rattled as he walked. I would later come to know this weapon by the name of <em>Woeful Mordred</em>, when I would bear witness of its glory.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Jin spoke flatly. His expression was as sharp as a razor.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty worked himself out of his seat. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; He ordered and Jin nodded. &quot;Olen, get topside and keep an eye on things.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Aye aye, Captain.&quot; Her voice was low and soft, and by the time she finished the sentence, she had made her way up the stairs.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of us proceeded through the heart of the ship to a small locker near the aft door. Dusty handed out breathing masks. Ones with transparent face covers, and tubes connected to small tanks with belts. We all donned the masks, got our belts cinched tight, and slid the tanks over our shoulders.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ll need this until we get inside.&quot; Dusty handed me mine while Sevrea and Jin donned theirs.</p>\n\n<p>I cleared it, making sure the seal was tight. Pulling air into my lungs was harder with the mask on. Sevrea turned to me. Her face was obscured by the worn masked. Through it, I could see her eyes and sensed she was worried about me. She nodded, gesturing to make sure I was good. I signaled, and we were off.</p>\n\n<p>The rear door opened with a hiss, and we stepped into the airlock. The sounds of the rain intensified. With the inner door sealed, a ramp folded down onto the wet landing area. Dusty reached towards the bulkhead and turned on a set of downward-facing lights. The dark, wet landing area appeared.</p>\n\n<p>Wind blew through the rain and fog, pushing it away in sheets. Our lights illuminated the landing area. It was a very large diamond shaped platform. &quot;Watch your head.&quot; Sevrea muffled as she moved towards the landing platform.</p>\n\n<p>We walked through the rain, following the edge of the landing pad towards a large door. Jin was first, with Dusty behind him, then Sev and I watching the shadows behind us. It was all quiet, other than the rain and wind, and the sound of our labored breathing.</p>\n\n<p>The path took us down a ramp that took us onto a widened path running alongside a round tower. The edges were partly built into the surrounding rock face, and partly built up on stilts. I looked back and our craft was visible, the lights illuminating the landing pad we stood on, the tower and the looming rain.</p>\n\n<p>It was the first time we could see our surroundings, and it was a strange sort of relief. The bright lights of our ship stood out against the dampened darkness of the black iron moons surface.</p>\n\n<p>Our group pressed forward, with Jin and I following. Jin stepped over a deep puddle of water. <em>Woeful Mordred</em> sloshed in his left hand, cradled against his chest.</p>\n\n<p>A battered sign above hung from a cross beam of the rig. Written in faded Athylian, it read &quot;Welcome to Ornus Mining Complex. Enjoy your stay.&quot; The irony was not lost on me, amid this foreboding complex.</p>\n\n<p>The rain was cold, and except for a breathing mask, I was unprotected. Our we slogged across the soaked pavement. <em>Normandie</em> lay still, rain dripping off her wings and down her back. Like her, I too, was getting soaked. My wet imperial clothes stuck to my shoulders. A flash of lightning blinked in the distance behind the rig and a silhouette of beams and metal appeared for a moment, towering above the landing pad.</p>\n\n<p>When we were close, Dusty said, &quot;Here we are.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>With the sound of screeching metal and a hiss, a narrow but heavy door opened into the rainy night. A small creature appeared and looked us over. We were covered in the rain and wearing masks. I say creature, but I don&#39;t know if was an animal or another being. It was short, maybe knee height, and stood with an upright posture. It was covered in shaggy dark grey-brown fur, and had three fingers on each hand.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Next time use the main entrance. Pad twelve. You know the drill.&quot; It hissed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll remember next time.&quot; Dusty said, pausing to send a hard-eyed flashing glance at Jin. I got the sense Dusty didn&#39;t forget where to land. He didn&#39;t want to draw any attention, I guessed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;All right come in. Come in.&quot; The bogmire responded, its tone a bit less contemptuous than before. Dark reptilian skin covered his body that stood half the height of Jin.</p>\n\n<p>The group huddled inside, and the creature squirmed by us closing the heavy door. With a whoosh, it sealed. Dusty then removed his mask. And so did the rest of us. It was easier to breathe without the mask, but taking a few breaths, I could smell the dampness.</p>\n\n<p>The bogmire mumbled to Dusty and collected his coin, before returning to a small stool further down the hall. He snorted as he lifted himself to return to his perch. Content to wait for more visitors and to collect more coins.</p>\n\n<p>We stuffed our breathing masks into Jin&#39;s backpack and traveled down a short but spacious hall lined with pipework, valves, and fittings. It wasn’t a well traveled area. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; Dusty said, leading us deeper into the rig.</p>\n\n<p>Trudging through wet clothing, we moved along into the transit area. We followed a short corridor, and the sounds of activity came at us from ahead. Workers came and went from the rooms we passed, some carrying trays, others pushing carts of materials.</p>\n\n<p>I then realized this was not a mining complex. At least, not anymore. At the end of the hall, we entered an enormous lively space. People were everywhere, seated, standing, hunched at bar stools, and leaning at gambling tables. A reptilian looking band played at the far side of the central area, blaring horns and plucking strings. It was loud, crowded, and hot, as the stench of tea fumes filtered through the air.</p>\n\n<p>Along the walls of the dim parlor were worn booths and tables where groups of characters drank and ate. Some were alone, slumped in their brews, while others had women on their laps, jewels around their necks, and bodyguards at their sides. A few were playing games at a long table. It was loud. The room was filled with smiles and hubbub, as if called by the band. Smoke hung in the air, and the scene was oppressive. But it was a comforting and bracing world, a welcome stranger&#39;s place.</p>\n\n<p>We were given a wide berth as we passed the tables, and were greeted with few glances. Most of the characters were ignoring us. We were not their concern.</p>\n\n<p>Wrapping the entire room was an overhanging balcony attached to two staircases on either end. Peering down from the balcony railing were women of all sorts. Watching the crowd, waiting for a call to arrive at a table. They were in various states of undress, or suggestively dressed, as if ready to jump from their perch. Some had claws, while others were covered in scales or fur or feathers. Here, there was someone for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>I was surprised by the thriving activity, in this mining rig. I was beginning to understand Ornus. It was a resort. A pleasure rig on a black iron moon. At least, it was now.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A lot of action,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is.&quot; Sev said. &quot;Wait until you see the upper levels.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty continued, &quot;Come on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ornus &quot;Mining&quot; complex obviously catered to a specific clientele. One who&#39;s wallets were thick and who had an appetite for a certain kind of company. It seemed like a good enough place to lay low, at least it was crowded enough that if the reef dwellers showed up I&#39;d have a chance to get away, maybe blend into the crowd. I thought about the worse case scenario, Greem discovering my whereabouts, tracking me down and demanding repayment for the unfortunate destruction of <em>Havre de Grace</em>. The thought of reasoning with him did cross my mind, but I quickly quelled that idea. He was not a reasonable creature.</p>\n\n<p>With the music booming and the sound of the crowd drinking, gaming and dancing, our group slipped through the crowd.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here we are.&quot; Dusty said, leading us to a small booth. He slid into one of the two seats, smiling. A feline looking woman smiled at him and handed him a glass of tawny colored liquid. He passed her a coin, and she smiled again. I didn&#39;t catch exactly what she said, but my guess she provided service and charged by the drink instead of the hour.</p>\n\n<p>Jin appeared uncomfortable. I wondered if he had been military trained. It looked as though the crowds and low lights, noice made him uncomfortable. Hard to keep track of the group.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea on the other hand slipped away to one of the low lit bars near the back of the club in search of trouble. &quot;See you.&quot; She said as she tossed us a half wave. Her body glided through the crowd and she disappeared amid the haze with a flick of her long dark hair. Sev always attracted attention, and I wondered who would catch her attention tonight.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Welcome to The Last Chance,&quot; Dusty said, rapping his fingers on the table. &quot;Bet you&#39;re a little surprised.&quot; He scrunched up his nose. &quot;Okay. A lot.&quot; He took a swig from his glass. Dusty seemed to be much more relaxed now, much more in his element.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Whats the plan Dusty?&quot; I asked. My voice became louder to fight the ambient noise.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty leaned back in his seat and laughed. &quot;Well first, you should try and relax. Those reef dogs would never think of coming here. It&#39;s not their kind of place.&quot; He gestures to the room. &quot;And if it makes you feel any better, I&#39;ll ask around, see if anyone&#39;s heard anything.&quot; Meanwhile, Jin can take a look around the rig for us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty gestured for Jin to go on, and released him from the seat. The big man got up and headed for a corner on the other side of the room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mmhmm,&quot; I said, watching Jin. He and his menacing weapon were moving to a position where they could keep an eye on the crowd. He was easily the biggest person in the room, and certainly the most threatening.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty smiled and extended a glass to me. &quot;Have a drink.&quot; I accepted, while he went on, &quot;Don’t know what you’re so worried about.&quot; He leaned in and lowered his voice, &quot;We&#39;ll be fine.&quot; A crowed cheered at a nearby gaming table, their clinks and clanking of winnings attractive.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Quite a place.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>An elegant creature walked past with a tray of drinks. It was a tall, dark skinned thing, wearing jeweled attire with lush flowing hair. As she walked, her hips swayed, making her tail swish from side to side. With triangular ears, inky lips and bright eyes, she looked as though she had been around the rig enough to know her way around.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She&#39;s a...&quot; I asked, curious about the unfamiliar creature.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Bokka.&quot; Dusty supplied. &quot;Beautiful things. And eager for your coin, aren&#39;t they?&quot; She trimmed her silken skirt and began carrying drinks back to the other tables around us. He leaned in, &quot;They like to bite.&quot; He said as she turned to approach our table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>Feeling her approach, I directed my attention to the nearing Bokka girl. Her delicate body neared, weaving through the crowd. She had a dancer&#39;s walk. Fluid and sensual, she made her way over.</p>\n\n<p>She bent down with a smile, placing the drinks on the table, swishing her tail. Dusty was captivated, falling for her feminine wiles.</p>\n\n<p>He asked her for her name, &quot;Sellae,&quot; she purred.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty struck up a conversation with the woman, asking about the band and where it was from, and engaged her in the usual, &quot;Where are you from? What do you do?&quot; type of conversation. Sellae was delighted to have his attention, but more delighted to have his coin. She deftly steered the conversation in a way to prompt Dusty to buy her a drink, which he did.</p>\n\n<p>The Bokka were a species known for their beauty and grace, with their tall, slender bodies and flowing hair. They hailed from a small planet known for its exotic flora and fauna, and were known for their love of music, dance, and the finer things in life. Their culture was one of sensuality and indulgence, with a focus on pleasure and enjoyment. They were often seen as hedonistic by other species, but to the Bokka, life was meant to be lived to the fullest.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of their place in the greater imperium, the Bokka were known for their talents as entertainers and courtesans. They were highly sought after for their beauty and charm, and were often found in the courts of the wealthy and powerful, as well as in high-end clubs and casinos.</p>\n\n<p>Despite their reputation as being shallow and self-indulgent, the Bokka were a highly intelligent and cunning species, with a deep understanding of human psychology and how to get what they wanted. They were known for their ability to manipulate and seduce, and were often seen as dangerous by those who did not understand them.</p>\n\n<p>As Dusty and I watched Sellae move through the crowd, it was clear that she was a master of her craft. She moved with an almost otherworldly grace, her body seeming to float on air as she glided from table to table.</p>\n\n<p>Her inky lips curved into a seductive smile as she chatted with the patrons, her triangular ears flicking this way and that as she listened to their requests and needs. She was a true Bokka, and it was clear that she was in her element.</p>\n\n<p>As I watched her work, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of admiration for her. Despite the common Bokka reputation, it was clear that she was much more than just a pretty face. She was a survivor, making her way in a tough and often unforgiving world.</p>\n\n<p>I smiled and turned my eyes to the audience, sipping my drink in quiet, observing the action. A crowd gathered at a nearby gaming table, loudly and animatedly betting on cards and dice.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here&#39;s to luck!&quot; One of them bellowed, and they shook their fists in the air at the table&#39;s winner.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll have a look around.&quot; I said, leaving Dusty and the Bokka girl to their conversation. I walked through the crowd, and made my way to the other side of the bar.</p>\n\n<p>The game of Xar was paying out well for the winner, who had won three previous rounds of the game. They clinked glasses and drank to their luck, the crowd cheered their fortunes. I made my way through the crowd, getting a closer look at the people playing the game and listening in to their conversations. </p>\n\n<p>A stern looking pit boss with arms crossed watched as the group tossed the dice once again. They held their breath, waiting for the result.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It’s a twelve!&quot; One of them shouted, and the crowd reacted.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Twelve! Yat! Winners winners.&quot; The dealer called out as the small crowd cheered again. I was intrigued by the game and came closer as the dealer doled out colored chips to the various winners.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Do you play?&quot; An older man asked after looking at me and taking sip from his clear, icy drink. His blue eyes looked me over, searching my appearance appraisingly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No. I&#39;m just passing by.&quot; I said, shaking my head.</p>\n\n<p>He gave me a wide smile. &quot;That&#39;s alright. You can still join us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is this?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Xar, my dear. Xar. It&#39;s the greatest game ever devised.&quot; He threw his hand out. &quot;Let me introduce you to it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There were five dice, all yellow with various black dots on each face, rolling across the table in a small circle, coming to a stop at a ring in the center. The dice bounced into the circle and began rolling. Several small bets were placed, the pit boss looked on.</p>\n\n<p>The game continued, it was then that I was offered another drink.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Drink, miss?&quot; A waitress with a broad smile asked, a drink in three of her arms, the other holding a small tray of assorted snacks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What&#39;ll you have, then?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I decided to order something light. Too much could make things complicated, particularly if any trouble showed up. The waitress nodded. &quot;And for you?&quot; She turned to the older man who was distracted by the table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah, keep the Old Quincy coming.&quot; He was drinking a strong liquor and winked at the waitress. She jotted down our order and departed.</p>\n\n<p>The game continued, and then the dice were rolled again. We watched the players, rubbing their hands and looking around at the crowd. The pit boss tapped on the table, a look of disbelief and excitement on his face. We watched as each die rolled into the center, then they were all laid out.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And where might you be hailing from then, miss?&quot; The older man spoke with an accent I’d never heard before.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kimler station.&quot; I was fearful of my colonial roots, so opted for something a little more neutral. We spoke as our drinks arrived. The waitress deposited them on the table while the older man watched me. He nodded at her as she wiped her fingers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kimler station eh? Out near Baysia? Well, miss you&#39;re a long way from home, then.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That I am.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Such a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The dice were rolled again. Each character moved backwards, they waited, eyes fixed on the small circle, awaiting the outcome of the roll.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What brings you to The Last Stand?&quot; He asked, still studying me.</p>\n\n<p>I cautiously checked over my shoulder then looked at his face when I said &quot;We&#39;re merchants.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of what sort?&quot; His eyes squinted as my face turned towards the table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The mining business.&quot; I answered, but my lack of confidence made it sound more like question. I looked at the dice again and cleared my throat.</p>\n\n<p>The man grinned a wide smile, revealing a set of gleaming yellow teeth. He lifted his drink and brought it to eye level, looking at me over the edge. &quot;Mm. A smuggler, are you?&quot; He laughed, a jolly chuckle. I squirmed a bit, caught off guard. &quot;You&#39;re in the right place if you are indeed a smuggler.&quot; He toasted his glass to mine, clinking our drinks together, although neither of us had yet to take a sip.</p>\n\n<p>A small group had gathered around us and the table. Some observed the game, others glanced at us and whispered among themselves. They huddled into groups and dialoged with one another, sharing drinks and taking in the action.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They call the dice of Xar the five thieves. If they land anywhere but the circle they steal from the game. But if they land in the circle, they pay. If they&#39;re not with you, they&#39;re against you, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The old man grabbed the dice cup and shook it around, rattling the dice inside. He pulled the dice out with a single hand and brought it to me, handing over the five dice with the dented face side up. &quot;Tell me young lady, which of these thieves do you think will betray me?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I guess we&#39;ll find out, won&#39;t we?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The old man watched intently as the dice hovered in the air for a moment, then fell onto the table. Two of the five thieves landed in the center, the other three went rolling off and away from the circle. The old man hollered and slapped the table as the dice passed the ring. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Seven. Colony&#39;s Seven. King takes it.&quot; The dealer&#39;s sing-song phrase evoked a jeer from the crowd and the old man as he swept their money into a hole in the table.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Had a good run, we did.&quot; He said. &quot;Good run lads! We&#39;ll get him next time then.&quot; He then yelled at the table and laughed. He seemed to not mind loosing or winning, he was having a grand time either way. Old quincy will do that.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kimler Station... Baysia, oh yes.&quot; He said, and got quieter. &quot;I hear of strange folk in the reef. Best be looking out miss.&quot; He nods.</p>\n\n<p>I pause for a moment and ask &quot;What of these folk?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What of them? Why the reef dwellers are nasty creatures they are.&quot; He stopped to take a drink and prepare his story. &quot;Old Jack Leavy was in the reef and he run aground in an ice pack. They came up and took everything but the clothes off his back they did. He had to fight for life and limb, killed a few mind you, but made it out.&quot; He takes another drink and places a small stack of chips one a place mark at the table. &quot;And old Jack hasn&#39;t been the same since. I&#39;d keep my nose out of there if I was you, miss. They just an&#39;t the kind of folk you want to be scrapping with.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Many thanks.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I try to remain calm in spite of the fear his story brings. I look around, as if I can only now see all the dangers that had been in plain sight before. I then realized there was a real chance of them tracking me down. After what I owed them, what I found? Why wouldn&#39;t they? News of strangers travels fast in the galaxy, a bystander could easily let slip our crew being here. I hoped it wouldn&#39;t come to that. I also hoped I wouldn&#39;t have to confront Greem, at least not until I figured out how to explain, and pay for <em>Grace</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I perused the club. Around the gaming tables, and booths along the wall, skirting the dance floor and stage, I finally arrived back where I started, the small table where Dusty and Sellae were.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty had his face buried in the Bokka woman&#39;s neck and she was wrapped in his arms. I coughed loudly to distract them. They looked at me guiltily. After a quick breath, and a blink, Dusty shot me an angry glare, as Sellae noticed me and stood. She adjusted her dress and gave me a sultry smile, excusing herself then leaving.</p>\n\n<p>Once she had left, I gave Dusty a cross look.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What?&quot; He spoke with a hushed tone, avoiding eye contact. &quot;You don&#39;t approve?&quot; He smirked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Would it matter if I did?&quot; His stare hardened as he sort of squinted at me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here.&quot; He stood and motioned towards a nearby bar. I followed and we both ordered a drink. We stood for a moment before he decided to break the silence. &quot;Well? What I did I tell you? We&#39;re fine. No sign of any, <em>any</em> reef dwellers.&quot; He concluded. I was not particularly confident. &quot;And besides –&nbsp;this place has security all over. Think of all the coin on the tables.&quot; He took a swig of his drink. &quot;We&#39;re good.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nodded with a bit of skepticism after taking another sip. </p>\n\n<p>Sevrea appeared from the darkness and stood at the bar next to me. She motioned to the bartender, and he obeyed, pouring a clear liquid into an iced glass, and sliding it to her.</p>\n\n<p>My plan was plain, but unfinished. First, take Dusty&#39;s advice and relax. Have a drink, then return to the ship and get some rest. I could lay low for a few cycles, then... I wasn&#39;t sure exactly. I knew I&#39;d come up with something to smooth things over with Greem, somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea looked at me, and asked, &quot;You look worried. Everything okay?&quot; She gave me a curious look, a knowing look.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; I lied. &quot;I&#39;m just…&quot; I feel this pit in my stomach. &quot;Ah it&#39;s nothing. Just catching up with Dusty, you know.&quot; I looked away, but into the bar. I felt a quick tap on my shoulder. &quot;Hmm?&quot; I queried.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty&#39;s nudged his head towards the entrance. Not many patrons noticed, but we did. A small group of heavily armed, thick looking creatures were harassing some of the crowd near the door. From the corner of the huge room, Jin and his <em>Mordred</em> were on alert. He didn&#39;t move toward them, instead he watched and assessed the situation. Keeping out of sight in the shadow against the far wall.</p>\n\n<p>I glanced at the thugs. Why were they here? Were they looking for me? I had to act. Dusty notified Sev of what was going on by nudging her as well. The two creatures, big and heavy dark colored things with white eyes were making their way through the crowd. Checking tables, perusing patrons.</p>\n\n<p>Sellae chose that moment to return. She scurried to our table, while being careful to avoid the invaders and their prey. She reached the table and tried to catch her breath. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; She asked, panting.</p>\n\n<p>Then I saw him. Greem. The beady eyed fiend from Malus VI had found me. I don&#39;t know how, but he did.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We need to go.&quot; I said, shifting my attention to her. &quot;Now. Now.&quot; I said. She jerked, startled by the urgency in my voice.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Greem.&quot; I said to Dusty.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>It was then I realized I had never told Dusty about what actually happened, how Greem&#39;s ship was destroyed and how he&#39;s going to think anything and everything I found belongs to him.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea kept drinking. Trying to finish her drink before the shooting started, this wasn&#39;t her first time. She had seen a <em>lot</em>. She knew exactly what was going to happen. I don&#39;t think anyone else in the room did.</p>\n\n<p>Jin signaled. He had been confronted by one of Greem&#39;s thugs. I nodded, motioned to Dusty and we turned back to the bar, awaiting the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Dusty listen, my ship... I mean <em>his ship</em>, got scrapped by the reef dwellers. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not happy about that and... oh there&#39;s this.&quot; I pull out <em>Reason to Believe</em> &quot;That he thinks belongs to him. See the in the reef... well it&#39;s a– a long story, all I know is–&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And with that, Greem and his thugs arrived at our little corner of The Last Chance. Sellae shrank down next to Dusty, and clutched his arm. He and Sevrea both poised and ready.</p>\n\n<p>A hush fell over the room, and the dancers on the stage stopped performing. The music from the band died as they watched the impending confrontation. Security cautiously made their way over to the big brute, but they seemed unsure. Probably because they weren&#39;t armed or armored like they should have been. They may have been trying to intimidate him, but it wasn&#39;t working.</p>\n\n<p>Greem and the thugs came forward, guns glinting in the neon lights overhead. They looked around, making sure none of their prey were hiding. They were looking for me.</p>\n\n<p>One of the thugs grabbed Sellae&#39;s arm and pulled her close to his body. &quot;Ey boss, found her!&quot; He exclaimed. She was less than half his size, and thrashed at him, kicking and scratching until finally she wormed free and hid behind Dusty again.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty stepped forward. &quot;What is it you want?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Move aside,&quot; said Greem. &quot;I have no business with you.&quot; The creature, with his hairless body, black eyes and dark scales. A glint from his gold tooth set against his smile in the middle of his face.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s what you think–&quot; Dusty replied. In an instant the butt of a rifle came down on Dusty&#39;s head; he fell like a rock.</p>\n\n<p>Sellae yelped, and rushed to his side. Her screams and pleas caused the room to fill with murmuring, security and patrons alike were shocked and confused.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s when Greem saw me. &quot;You.&quot; He said. It wasn&#39;t a question. &quot;Where is it?&quot; He asked. My heart sank. He knows. &quot;The ship. Where is it?&quot; He asked again a toothy grin.</p>\n\n<p>I could feel the tension building in my chest. I wanted to let loose on the creature. But I knew it wasn&#39;t the time or place–too many people, too many innocent civilians. I didn&#39;t want to put them in danger. <em>I</em> would take care of this.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Nice to see you again.&quot; Somehow, I managed to muster the courage to say it. I tried to keep a neutral expression.</p>\n\n<p>The two creatures stood, weapons at the ready and pointed right towards Sev and I. Greem approached, his eyes set on mine.</p>\n\n<p>He spoke slowly, stepping with a limp. &quot;Where. Is it?&quot; He demanded. The </p>\n\n<p>immense creature looked each of us. Starting with Sev, then moving his gaze to Sellae and Dusty who had regained his senses.</p>\n\n<p>I feigned negotiations with Greem. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.&quot; I replied. I could feel the eyes of everyone in the room on me. I had to think of something. &quot;Look, whatever it is you want, we can work something out.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not the fool you think me to be. Now bring me the prize.&quot; He took a step forward, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.</p>\n\n<p>I watched as Jin gave me a subtle nod from high above. My heart raced as I prepared for the chaos that was about to ensue. Suddenly, a whistle sounded from the balcony and all hell broke loose. Screams and shouts filled the air as tables went flying and people ducked for cover. I saw Sellae helping Dusty stand and make their way to safety. The thugs took aim, ready to follow their boss&#39;s command to kill us all. I braced myself, unsure of what the next few seconds would bring.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kill them.&quot; He commanded. &quot;All of them.&quot; The two thugs took aim. As they did, we heard a whistle from the balcony. It was Jin, armed with <em>Woeful Mordred</em>. Greem and his thugs looked up, distracted by the noise.</p>\n\n<p>In an instant, the whole place erupted into chaos. Screams, shouts and gunfire entered the fray. Tables went flying, those in the crossfire ducked down. Sellae helped Dusty stand, and they made for cover.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea had a different idea. She downed the rest of her drink, and threw the glass at one of the thugs. It shattered against his face, momentarily stunning him. She then drew her gun, and dispatched him like an outlaw. The reptiliform thing tumbled to the ground with a gurgling shriek. I lost sight of her in the chaos, but could hear her gun still barking amidst the melee. It was clear that she was still alive and fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Greem fired wildy in response. &quot;I said kill them!&quot; His rage was palpable above the din of the fight.</p>\n\n<p><em>Woeful Mordred</em> was a force to be reckoned with as it rained down destruction from above. The weapon let out a deafening roar, releasing a hail of bolts that shattered the glass above the bar. Jin&#39;s aim was deadly, hitting his targets with precision. Injured creatures crawled out from their hiding spots, their cries of pain echoing through the chaos.</p>\n\n<p>A single bolt from <em>Mordred</em> grazed Greem&#39;s shoulder. He bellowed with anger, and returned fire. Sparks flew from the balcony as Jin was forced to retreat.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal! You and your friends are dead!&quot; shouted Greem. He took another shot at Jin, keeping <em>Mordred</em> at bay.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea appeared beside me, wild eyed and sweating. &quot;Whi-what&#39;s going on? Who are these guys?&quot; she asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Pirates. They&#39;re after me.&quot; I replied. &quot;We need to get out of here.&quot; I looked around the room.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea nodded, her eyes wild with adrenaline. &quot;Got it,&quot; she replied, leaping over the bar and firing off another round at Greem&#39;s thugs. &quot;Jin!&quot; she shouted. &quot;We need to go!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Her firearm sent a volley of shots as she challenged Greem&#39;s thugs. I heard a cry of pain, not sure if it was friend or foe, and then the unmistakable click of her weapon running dry.</p>\n\n<p>Dipping behind an overturned table, she attempted to reload. That&#39;s when Greem struck. He heaved the table into the air and snatcher her like a toy. His claws dug into her flesh, her screams pierced the room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sevrea!&quot; I shouted, revealing myself. Greem turned to face me. A predatory grin returned to his face. The bogmire hissed something vile, then heaved Sevrea against a nearby cabinet. She fell motionless, her empty weapon skittered across the floor.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You.&quot; He seethed. &quot;This ends now.&quot; He turned to face me, bloodlust in his eyes.</p>\n\n<p>The firing from above stopped and Jin yelled something I couldn&#39;t make out through the ringing in my ears and eruption of patrons, screaming and rushing. He then fired <em>Woeful Mordred</em> at an oncoming horde of creatures near the front entrance.</p>\n\n<p>A power built on my right hip. I pulled it free, it had been waiting for this moment. The power coursed through my right arm, up my hand and through the grip of <em>Reason to Believe</em>. I pulled the trigger. I took several shots at Greem, and grazed him once. The creature hit the ground and screamed out in rage. He turned towards me and tried to fire back with his weapon, but never pulled the tigger.</p>\n\n<p>A detonation sent a shockwave through the room that knocked us all to the ground. Fragments of wood, metal and stone peppered the area. A cloud of dust rose up, an acrid burning smell filled my nostrils. I lay there for a moment, dazed. I didn&#39;t know what happened. I couldn&#39;t see anyone through the smoke, including Jin or Greem.</p>\n\n<p>Jin was it. Even amidst the chaotic din and smoke, I could hear his cry of pain, followed by the sound of him falling.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Jin!&quot; I shouted, crawling to my feet. My voice was lost in the tumult.</p>\n\n<p><em>Woeful Mordred</em> had fallen to the lower floor from the balcony. Where was Jin? I had no idea. I only had a few seconds to act before the Greem too had recovered from the explosion.</p>\n\n<p>Greem was dazed from the grenade. The creature stumbled, then fell to its knees. Bits of glass and metal protruded from his flesh. He tried to rise, but failed. It was then I realized his leg was wounded, the bone protruding through the muscle. He screamed in pain and fury, the lower half of his right leg had been shredded by the shrapnel.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty cried out my name in horror. We were already too far into our fatalistic state of mind. It fired again and again until it stopped. I had run out of rounds.</p>\n\n<p>Click. Click. I pulled the trigger over and over. Click. Click.</p>\n\n<p>The hot barrel smoked grey wisps and Greem&#39;s body lay before me, dead.</p>\n\n<p>I wiped the blood from my eyes, the tears and sweat mixing. I collapsed to my knees, heart racing, and my vision blurred. I felt cold. I don&#39;t know how long I sat there. I was in shock. I couldn&#39;t think. I couldn&#39;t move. I just stared at the bodies and the monsters I had killed. What had I done?</p>\n\n<p>A voice called out to me, it was faint and distant. I couldn&#39;t make out the words. I couldn&#39;t focus. I just sat there.</p>\n\n<p>The voice became more insistent. I turned and saw Sevrea, leaning against the bar. She was battered and bruised, but she was alive. Dusty stood behind me, panting and out of breath. Sellae had a cut on her face and was wiping her tears, crying and staring at me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Jin!&quot; Dusty had been crying out for him.</p>\n\n<p>I put my weapon away called to Jin. &quot;Jin!&quot; I heard a cough from above on the balcony. He was alive. Sev pulled herself slowly up and looked between Dusty and I, the three of us in disbelief that we had all survived.</p>\n\n<p>People began to emerge from beneath the tables or stand and dust off. Some cried, some yelled, some shouted, some screamed at us. None of us spoke or made eye contact with anyone.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We need to go.&quot; said Jin, as he limped down from the balcony - he was hurt but still functioning. &quot;We need to go now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We took one last look at the place where they so many creatures painfully and recklessly spent their last moments; we all felt remorse, but did what we had to do to survive.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty gave Sellae an arm to lean on as they accepted their sombre sendoff. She was still crying. Her hands covered her face and her body shook with the sobs.</p>\n\n<p>The rumble of distant explosions and gunfire meant the private security forces had encountered Greem&#39;s crew. &quot;Lets go.&quot; Sev said as she took Dusty by the hand and led everyone into the corridor. As we ran, we donned our face masks and respirators. Clearing the main room, we saw the fighting had spilled out into the hallway.</p>\n\n<p>Through the back corridors and onto the dark and wet landing area, we met more of Greem&#39;s creatures. Two of them, like their leader, lay dead. Slain by security forces. Another two were battling it out, exchanging fire with the dark clad squad. We snaked right and tried to take the stairs. There we met a flash of light and the sound of more explosions, the same that almost took out Jin.</p>\n\n<p>We took another route - past Greem&#39;s people, down more stairs and out into a darkened area of the pad. The ship- it was still there, across the open expanse of the landing pad turned battle zone. Then there was a shout from behind us. The voice was gravelly. We heard the creature load his weapon. The first round missed. The second went wide too.</p>\n\n<p>Jin, even while limping and moments after fighting for his life was faster than the creature. Jin turned and fired first. He felled the creature with a brace of bullets that spun him through the air of the landing pad. Another creature appeared. He unloaded again, with lethal accuracy. It took a hit in the chest and fell to the ground.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on!&quot; He shouted and we all ran for the ship. Security forces were everywhere now, mowing down anything that moved. We were caught in the crossfire. A stray round hit the ground and ricocheted damaging the glass shield of Dusty&#39;s respirator.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty and Sev again took the lead. I followed behind Jin, his limp obvious as we ran.</p>\n\n<p>At the edge of the landing pad, the ship was now in sight. I blinked hard, realizing the ship hadn&#39;t been touched during the battle. It sat like a beacon on a hill, unharmed by the havoc ensuing around it. A score of bogmire bodies lay scattered about. Their weapons and armor flung to the ground, some gruesome and dismembered. It was a massacre. But how? I gave my head a shake and ran towards it, worried something even more menacing was about.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on!&quot; I yelled at Jin, who was now badly lagging behind. We were all tiring, the running and the fear taking their toll. His labored breaths fogged his mask. I grabbed his hand and pulled him onwards.</p>\n\n<p>Shimmering puddles shook with the sound of heavy foot fells. I stopped and turned. I fired and missed. I stared at the creature approaching me, his long strides quickly eating up the distance between us. I saw him raise his gun, a sleek, black and deadly looking weapon, the likes of which I had never seen before. It wore a thick hide, plated with metal and bristled with thick scales. Its face was hidden with a battle helm, moving its head, it surveyed the area.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t long before it spotted our group. The creature snarled and rumbled with purpose towards us. It roared in n language I didn&#39;t understand, bellowing orders to the remaining bogmire creatures. The thing then raised a large canon at us, and took aim with its single, bulbous eye. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Run!&quot; I yelled, my command muted by the mask. I could see Jin shaking his head. For a moment, he didn&#39;t want to run. He wanted to fight the thing, send the thing back to Hell or wherever it was it came from, but he knew better.</p>\n\n<p>As it leveled it weapon, I spread out my arms in defense, readying myself for the inevitable blast that would surely follow. But the creature didn&#39;t press its advantage. Instead, as if in slow motion, the thing&#39;s head simply exploded. One moment it was there, the next it wasn&#39;t. Replaced by red mist, bone and blood.</p>\n\n<p>The mighty thing&#39;s body fell limp as it wobbled like headless a puppet with severed strings. Its once-deadly weapon now forgotten in its lifeless hand.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time the toll of a bell sounded. A deep and ominous sound that struck our our ears from somewhere beyond the veil, a call from the damned that seemed to herald death. Despite the chaos and danger around us, the tolling seemed to command a sense of reverence and respect.</p>\n\n<p>I stared in awe at the beheaded creature. As the ringing faded away, the battlefield fell silent, as if the bell had cast a spell of calm over the fray. I looked around, trying to understand. What happened? What had saved us?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There!&quot; Dusty cried, pointing at the ship. Waving at us atop <em>Normandie</em> was Olen. Laying prone, with what appeared to be a tremendously powerful railgun paired with high powered optics. She had unleashed terrifying and unholy weapon. A weapon from beyond the dark, and deadly beyond description. Its chime was the toll of death.</p>\n\n<p>I smiled. A stupid smile. Laughing, I grabbed Dusty and Sev, dragging them in the direction of the ship. We raced to Olen as fast as we could, each of us hugging the other. Finally we were near. We were going to make it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Move!&quot; Sev yelled.</p>\n\n<p>We ran across the landing pad, dodging bogmire bodies, and sprinting across the rain soaked concrete. Finally, we’re close. Sev and Dusty reached the ship first. They were smiling. I gave chase, but Jin was ahead of me, with only one working leg and an injured hand. But he ran towards the ship.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hurry.&quot; I said, catching up to Jin, bending over to help him up and on to the ship. As I grabbed him, I felt a small hand wrap itself securely around mine. I looked down. There was Sev, clutching my hand and helping me pull Jin up.</p>\n\n<p>As we reached ship, Olen slipped down into the top hatch. Jin collapsed on the ramp, exhausted, and Dusty helped me pull him the rest of the way up. We all fell inside</p>\n\n<p>I laughed out loud. I couldn&#39;t stop myself. The ship was undamaged, and somehow, we were alive.</p>\n\n<p>Our savior greeted us with a proud smile on her face, wearing a wet camouflage raincoat. She unslung her long rifle leaned it against the hull. It was a slender weapon, longer than she was tall, and as pitch-black as the void. Beautiful, powerful, and damned. I would come to know this weapon by the name <em>Penumbra, the Lance of Shadows</em>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Olen was an Aaru. One of the few that left their peaceful and humble outer rim planet to seek adventure. Most Aaruians have no desire to leave their homeworld. They&#39;ll make do. They&#39;re modest and stubborn folk. But there was one that did want to see the galaxy. That Aaru was Olen.</p>\n\n<p>Her story started over a century ago when the growing empire was still strong in the Aaruian heart. When a young and reckless Aaru chose adventure over the peaceful life of tranquility, she left her homeworld and journeyed deep into the uncharted wilds of the galaxy.</p>\n\n<p>She traveled for many years with two well-connected companions, Ellysia and Gaiar – both long since dead – and made their way to the Athylian capital. There, Olen decided to try and join the Imperial Navy as a pilot. She felt her natural ability and reflexes would make her a valuable asset to the service. She was surprised to discover that few in the capital were eager to accept her into their ranks.</p>\n\n<p>Olen Abeona, being a woman of character and stubbornness, refused to give up on her dream. For months, she trained in private. Ellysia and Gaiar were two of the most esteemed Aaruian pilots in their day. Having strong ties to certain families in the capital, they agreed to help Olen ensure she was accepted into the fleet.</p>\n\n<p>For over a year, Olen suffered under the weight of Gaiar and Ellysia&#39;s plan. When the time was right, Gaiar and Ellysia presented Olen to a noble Duke, whose house was in need of promising pilots. House Saros, it was called, and the extraordinary Aaruian pilot tempted the Duke.</p>\n\n<p>Although her skill may have been exaggerated by Gaiar and her qualifications by Ellysia, the Duke was impressed by her talent and natural abilities. It didn&#39;t hurt matters that the young and graceful female met his tastes as well. He was enamored with Olen. The Aaru really do have all the advantages.</p>\n\n<p>And, the Athylian Imperial Navy, in preserving their power, understood the importance of fostering ties with families who may one day support the metropole. House Saros was one such family. Therefore, they agreed to sponsor Olen&#39;s admission immediately, even if it meant adding a plebeian woman, a commoner, and an Aaru to their roster.</p>\n\n<p>Olen struggled early on. Her peers proved over and over that she had no place among their ranks. Her lack of noble blood meant she would never be accepted in the military. They despised her, but she would not quit so easily. The Aru needed a way to prove herself. She decided to augment her accomplishments with a skill most pilots lacked, the use of firearms. Before long, she had become a highly-skilled marksman. Her weapon of choice was a long rifle. Olen was an excellent shot.</p>\n\n<p>Her prowess with a long rifle was renowned among the Athylian elite. Thus began Olen&#39;s rises to power in the empire, earning herself accolades, decorations, and a seat in the inner circle. Olen stood on top of the very empire that once rejected her so soundly.</p>\n\n<p>A rising star, and now a captain, she was hand selected by her superiors to enter a paramilitary, and highly classified unit. Requirements were beyond strict, and only the most elite pilots were selected. Olen was one of them. Little did she know, her new unit was one of the most shadowy and secret organizations in the empire.</p>\n\n<p>Olen became a part of the Athylian&#39;s secret service, called The Reapers. This was a clandestine group of highly trained operatives. Established under the command of Commandant Ernst Tolk, the group hunted ancient relics and dark things, seeking to acquire the most incredible artifacts of the distant past, while prying into the mysteries of the darkest corners of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Reapers were not the typical soldiers. They were handpicked and specially trained. Each Reaper was an expert in their field. They were stealthy and cunning, and they were lethal. They were the best of the best.</p>\n\n<p>The imperial Reapers were a mysterious and formidable force within the Athylian Empire. Their origins were shrouded in secrecy, with only whispers and rumors circulating among the general populace. Some said they were the personal guard of the Emperor, sworn to protect him at all costs. Others claimed they were a shadowy organization of assassins, dispatched to eliminate any threats to the empire.</p>\n\n<p>Olen has shared few details of what she&#39;s seen, and I&#39;m sure she has many secrets buried deep. Some talk of horrors she&#39;s witnessed on worlds lost in the outer darkness, of the strange things she&#39;s recovered from the ruins of past ages. Of the impossible things she&#39;s defeated.</p>\n\n<p>The Aaruian woman didn&#39;t limit her achievements to the Empire. She was a brilliant leader and refined the tactics of the rebellion movement during the War of the Seven Colonies. Her successes were numerous, including the framing of the Eighth Imperial Fleet, an attack on an Imperial Shipyard, and the ambushing of the Imperial fleet over the planet of Dez, which confirmed the Athylian involvement in the massacre of the Sol&#39;Nanar.</p>\n\n<p>Despite her efforts, Olen could not shake the Empire. Her victories did not sway the course of the war. After the war and the signing of the Colonial Peace and Security Act, the military of the Empire was back on its feet, eager for revenge on its former adversaries. Olen had become a pariah of sorts, scorned and despised by many of the nobility, and was targeted by the Empire. She was forced to go into hiding.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after months of the relentless pursuit, Olen decided to cut her losses and flee the imperial core. She made her way to Kathala, barely escaping capture, and hid among the nomads of the frigid planet. So remote, even the hand of the Empire could touch her there. No one knew of her presence on Kathala, save the people she befriended and various traders, smugglers, and pirates she worked with on occasion.</p>\n\n<p>For many years, life was quiet in the icy fjords. Olen wasted not a moment of her time and tried her best to forget the horrors of her past. Or did she? I often wonder if the war ever truly ended for Olen, if she ever purged herself of the things she experienced. It would seem as though she carries unseen wounds, which seem to always keep her at war within herself.</p>\n\n<p>Like a flame, Olen&#39;s will was fanned, and once more she picked up her lance. The pirate Captain Dusty Hammond landed on Kathala at just the right time, when Olen needed the sort of protection Dusty could offer her. Over a year, an unlikely friendship formed between the two pilots, one of mutual need and trust.</p>\n\n<p>However, Olen never felt safe, always looking over her shoulder. Her actions on worlds large and small had made her an enemy of Athylia, and she knew that danger would always stalk her steps. History and myth are rarely kind.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>&quot;Good to see you in one piece.&quot; Olen said with a smile, holding him tightly. She looked at each of us in turn, nodding. Then, Dusty grabbed&nbsp;her extended arm and pulled himself up.</p>\n\n<p>Olen finished her warm hug with Dusty then looked over to Jin, who was leaning on the ramp wall, clutching at his bleeding leg. &quot;Once again Jin, I saved your a–.&quot; She stopped mid-sentence. With a look of concern on her face &quot;You&#39;re hurt.&quot;, She said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. There&#39;s more of them coming.&quot; Jin pushed her away. He was a tough, bull-headed. Olen shook her head and stood up, she reached down to take Jin&#39;s hand. &quot;Come on.&quot; she said. He entered the ship, leaned against the bulkhead.</p>\n\n<p>She helped Jin into the ship then turned to Sev, who looked at her with pleading eyes. The two friends didn&#39;t say anything to each other, but Olen did bend down and place her arms around the smaller woman. After holding her for a short moment, she then supported Sev up to the ramp.</p>\n\n<p>Olen turned to me, next, but before I had a chance to turn towards her, she was at my side, helping me aboard. &quot;You look exhausted.&quot; She said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Aye.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>We stepped through the hatch and boarded the ship as the ramp retracted. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Start the engines,&quot; Dusty commanded. &quot;Get us the hell out of here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sev, the medkit is in the galley, help Jin.&quot; Olen said while running to the bridge with Dusty.</p>\n\n<p>Sev left for the galley, and Jin leaned hard against the wall. I could tell he was hiding his pain. I reached out to take his arm and together we made our way to the berthings.</p>\n\n<p>We could hear the engines whirring below decks. The ship was moving, no doubt already on its way off the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Sev returned with the medical kit, took two small boxes, and handed them to Jin. She checked the supply of bandages, then gauze. &quot;Let me help.&quot; she said with her perseid accent. Jin nodded and lifted his left arm so Sev could wrap the gauze tightly around his thigh. The big man hissed in pain, then she worked on his right arm.</p>\n\n<p>Sev wrapped bandages around his arm, her fingers were calloused and rough, but her touch was soft and warm. With care, she covered his wounds, stopping as he winced in pain.</p>\n\n<p>Jin grunted as he started to bleed onto the bandage. His muscular leg was covered with blood where the laser wound had gone through cleanly, but the impact from the beam had flown some of the molten flak off into his leg, burning it through. He must have been in unbelievable pain.</p>\n\n<p>Sev cursed in a language I didn&#39;t understand and threw the medical kit back in its place. &quot;I&#39;m no doctor.&quot; she said.</p>\n\n<p>She looked at the bloody bandages and then back at Jin. She was clearly concerned. She didn&#39;t say much else but we could both tell what she thought. This wasn&#39;t enough. There was no way to treat him here. We needed to get him to a doctor. Her gaze met mine and it with silent agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Just then, the ship rocked violently to the side. Equipment flew off the shelves onto the deck. &quot;What now?&quot; Sev asked aloud, tearing off the last of the bandage.</p>\n\n<p>The ship rocked again, harder than before, emitting an unfamiliar grinding noise. Then a pop and hiss as the metal of the ship twisted and buckled. I lost my balance and stumbled. The cabin pressure changed as I struggled to keep my balance. We were under attack.</p>\n\n<p>Another jarring impact and the ship began to list towards the left side. An alarm sounded. Sev, and I moved to the port side of the berthings to brace ourselves against the bulkhead. The ship rocked again and this time was sent sideways. Olen&#39;s terse voice was heard over the communication line. &quot;Could use you up here.&quot; She said, &quot;Take it through the top hatch!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Heading Olens words, Jin grunted to get up but yelped in pain. Breathing hard through his teeth. He couldn&#39;t stand. The rush that got him through the battle had all but worn off. He needed to recover. He needed medical attention. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;No.&quot; I said.&quot; Stay here. Sev and I will go, you rest.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No…&quot; he protested. He was breathing hard, gripping his leg.</p>\n\n<p> Sev grabbed the railing of the bulkhead. &quot;We&#39;ll be back, Jin. Promise.&quot; She said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re heading to the bridge!&quot; I yelled into the corridor, having no idea how to use the intercom.</p>\n\n<p>She replied, &quot;Bring the guns up, A-&quot; static interrupted her call over the intercom &quot;- forward guns.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The ship rocked again. This time though, I grabbed the bulkhead and hung on. &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; I wailed into the corridor. The deck shook, dust and debris rained down from the ceiling above.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea knew what to do. I</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Go!&quot; Sev shouted as Olen&#39;s voice came over the intercom.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Gun Deck!&quot; Jin said as we headed to the hatch.</p>\n\n<p>Together we moved through the metal halls towards the forward lower deck of the ship. The lights flickered - the ship&#39;s power was failing. We moved quickly, dodging smoke and torn wiring that ran from panel to panel, occasionally sparking on contact. Light fixtures shattered as we passed, sending shards of glass showering over us.</p>\n\n<p>We arrived at the turret bays, of which there were two, one on each side of the ship. These heavy caliber guns, if wielded by someone like Jin, would offer a good amount of protection on all sides. I was nervous about using the guns though. I had never fired one before. The whole battle seemed like a bad dream - a dream that hadn&#39;t ended yet.</p>\n\n<p>The ship rocked again, hard. Sev and I clung to each other to stay upright. The ship listed to the starboard side slightly as I threw myself into the gunners seat. Looking through the glass of the window, I was shocked to see an ensuing space battle playing out. A couple of Greem&#39;s fighters were going at it with another, larger ship. The inky blackness of space juxtaposed against the blinding light of gunfire and explosions. All the while, our ship, the <em>Normandie Place</em> was hurling along in the blurry chaos.</p>\n\n<p>I looked to Sev and raised an eyebrow.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve... never done this.&quot; She said to me, realizing my lack of experience after noticing the look on my face.</p>\n\n<p>The ship rocked once more, followed by an alarming grinding sound. I could tell the ship was on its last legs. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Time to learn.&quot; she breathed, then pointed &quot;Trigger, charging handle, sights. Got it?&quot; She said quickly.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded, trying to focus. In a flash she was out the door. My eyes darted around the window. &quot;What do I shoot?&quot; I asked myself, then again yelling it &quot;What do I shoot!?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Everything!&quot; She replied. My heart was fluttering. I reached out and took the charging handle and pulled it, the turret swiveled with a satisfying sliding of metal and whizzing, the barrel now facing forward. The seat swiveled as I aimed the barrel towards the fight. </p>\n\n<p>A flurry of ships and cannon fire flashed by the windows. Greem&#39;s forces had engaged the local system security in a fierce battle above the atmosphere. We were moving away from the large ship that was battling Greem&#39;s fighters. We must have been caught in its ion wake, but now we were picking up speed away from the scene. &quot;Hang on!&quot; Olen&#39;s voice came over the comm again.</p>\n\n<p>The explosions got closer, and I flinched as the counter-attack took out a fighter. The light flashes were becoming closer, too. I felt an impact and then the predictable, sickening spinning motion that came with evasive maneuvers in space. I twisted the barrel of the turret and sighted in a group of small craft. I hit the trigger. The gun rattled giving off a high pitched screeching sound. Beams of energy flung into the blackness of space.</p>\n\n<p>Tracking one of the ships, I pulled down on the trigger again, the gun recoiled in my arms with a pressure that pushed my fist back. All the while, the small fighters were growing larger in my sights. I could see the specks of laser fire on the silver craft in my sight and pulling the trigger, I instilled more destruction upon them.</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought I had missed them, but then I saw the fighter explode. One down, maybe thirty to go. I pulled on the handle and the turret swung left. Another fighter was headed straight for us. I lashed out with rapid fire, and the fighter burst into flames. It crumbled, floated towards my window then tumbled away into the vastness of space. </p>\n\n<p>I looked back out the window at the other ships that were now closing in on us. I squeezed the trigger and fired. I was doing well. I felt a rush of adrenaline, my right hand was shaking, and my heart was pounding. Another fighter flew by, I compensated and fired again, this time I missed. A slew of laser fire came at the ship. A warning came over the comm, Sev&#39;s voice yelled out. &quot;Here we go!&quot; we were spinning and I crashed against the back of the seat. </p>\n\n<p>Another barrage of cannon fire came at the ship. I had to readjust my aim. I started firing at the closest ship. My shots were starting to find their mark. They were close, and their laser fire was starting to make me nervous. The turret spun to the left as we rolled to the right. Another blast of fire came at the ship. It was like a punch to the gut. We shuddered, and the turret started to shake. The safety harness bit into my chest and shoulders, but still my finger was on the trigger. </p>\n\n<p>Our motion steadied, but we were still on a course into the storm. Dusty and Olen must have worked out a strategy. Swirling clouds filled the view, and I began loosing track of the fighters. Water droplets were forming on them glass of the turret. I could hardly see anything. I scanned looking for another target. It was too late, a fighter fired a strafe against the hull.</p>\n\n<p><em>Normandie Place</em> trembled, and a loud growling sound came from behind us. The communication with Olen was cut off. Had we lost power?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sev!&quot; I screamed over the shrieking an alarm and the hissing of the ship loosing air. My heart was pounding in my ears. I shut down the turret and hurried out of the seat. Lighting flashed in the outside hallway. We were descending into the thick of the storm.</p>\n\n<p>The ship&#39;s engines were out and we were adrift, spiraling into the squall. Other than the hull groaning, the ship fell quiet. No ventilation fans or the hum of the engines. I could hear explosions and cannon fire in the distance. There was a chance we&#39;d loose them.</p>\n\n<p>I pushed in through the doorway of the crew quarters. &quot;Jin!?&quot; I yelled amid the red emergency lighting. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; I could tell he wasn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sev, where are you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; she said from down the hall in the engineering compartment. I ducked under a fallen coolant pipe and entered the darkened engineering area. The deck was flooded to our ankles in red fluid, with some parts deeper than others given the angle the ship was sitting.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thrust is gone.&quot; Sev said. She was using a small flashlight to locate a panel along the bulkhead. &quot;Here we go.&quot; She said splashing over to it and putting the flashlight in her teeth illuminate the panel cover. She pried it open and started to fiddle with some of the wiring, I could only guess at what she was doing, but she didn&#39;t look happy.</p>\n\n<p>A voice came from down the hall. &quot;Any luck?&quot; It was Dusty. He knew she&#39;d be on the problem. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Just give me a second.&quot; She said. She was reaching up, elbow deep into an electrical panel and ankle deep in liquid coolant. Outside, we could hear the storm itself. As if we were surrounded by a hurricane in space, turbulence was softly rattling parts of the ship.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Got it.&quot; She yelled. The lights clicked on and Sev closed the panel. I felt a slight lilt in the floor as the gravity popped back to full force.</p>\n\n<p>I could hear Sev breathing heavily. &quot;We have power. Not much else though, the main reactor is offline. At least until we can get these coolant lines fixed. We got lucky.&quot; she said. Sloshing towards me.</p>\n\n<p>She gave me a quick nod and started off back towards where Jin was. We looked at him through the hatch of the berths. He was passed out - maybe from pain, maybe from exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>We made our way to the bridge. There, Dusty and Olen were hunched over a table of charts and maps. Through the windows we saw a thick purple and blue fog, swirling about the ship. In the distance were pops of white light, diffused through the clouds. It wasn&#39;t lightning, it was the ensuing battle taking place above the storm. Somehow they&#39;ve lost us, and are too busy battling each other to start a search.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Reactor is down. We lost the cryo-plant. And... coolant is everywhere.&quot; Sev said, wiping red liquid from her hands.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How&#39;s Jin?&quot; Dusty asked. He looked worried. Even Olen looked concerned.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Not good.&quot; She said. &quot;We&#39;ll need more hands if we want to get this ship fixed. He&#39;s going to need help too.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Dusty sighed, then stood up. And looked out the window of the bridge. Did he resent me for getting us into this mess? I didn&#39;t know what to think. I had only just met these people, and I had caused a lot of pain. I knew I needed to fix it. I had to.</p>\n\n<p>We spent the next two hours patching the ship as best we could. Cleaning up the coolant and repairing the electrical system and cryo-plant. It was a lot of work, and we were all soaked and frozen at the end of it. But at least the ship was somewhat space-worthy.</p>\n\n<p>Outside, the battle seemed to have died down. We may never know who won. Probably nobody. Especially not us. Not Jin. Not <em>Normanide Place</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We finally had a moment to rest. The crew needed it. I changed out of my soaked clothes, and got some hot tea and food in the galley. Sev stayed with Jin. He was awake, but deteriorating. Olen, Dusty and I contemplated our next move. </p>\n\n<p>We were all looking at star charts, several once all laid out on the table in the galley. Some empire-spec, others much less formal.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s a listening outpost about an hour from here. Sabletide.&quot; Olen said, pointing to an empty spot on the map. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s empty space, Olen.&quot; I said not seeing anything. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Look again.&quot; She said softly. Her finger traced a path on the map, and as if hidden by an optical illusion, the mark on the map become visible to my eyes. I couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. It was as if it had been there all along and I couldn&#39;t see it. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What?&quot; How? I breathed. Not being able to unsee the mark now clearly visible. I touched it to see if it would rub away.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It’s an cant map, Amal.&quot; She replied. &quot;Written in a cryptolect that you can only see if you&#39;ve seen it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I looked at Dusty as if it was magic. He shrugged as if it was everyday for him. I shook my head. </p>\n\n<p>Sev entered the galley. &quot;Thieves maps. These are used by pirates to plan their routes. Safe harbors, outposts, bounty routes.&quot; She said. &quot;Pirates pass these around.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And you know about this?&quot; I asked. I was still having trouble believing my eyes. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I lived on Tartarus for a time.&quot; she said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;City of thieves.&quot; Dusty didn’t look up as he spoke.</p>\n\n<p>As if my eyes could go any wider. &quot;I heard they were all killed in an attack.&quot; I added.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You’d be right.&quot; Sev said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Moving on.&quot; Olen said. &quot;Like I said, the outpost is an hour by superluminal drive. But the reactor chiller burned out when the cryoplant shut down.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And we can&#39;t exactly go asking around for one.&quot; Sev said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Dusty asked. &quot;It&#39;s not like reactor parts are floating around.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I thought for a moment. &quot;Or maybe they are.&quot; I said. Dusty looked at me quizzically. &quot;I have an idea. Sev, can you rig up a radiometer?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot; She paused. &quot;But why?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Back when I worked on Greem&#39;s salvage crew, we used to tune them to track the signatures of wrecked ships. And lucky for us we&#39;re floating in a battlefield.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re right, Amal. This might work. There&#39;s bound to be a wreck up there that&#39;s got at least some cryo gear we can salvage.&quot; The gears were turning in Sev&#39;s head as she spoke.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s going to pick up all traces. Not only wrecked ships, but ones that are armed. And manned. And ones that one us dead.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Leave that to me.&quot; I said. I spent months following these signals. I was confident I could tune it enough for our purposes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Alright.&quot; Sev said. &quot;I&#39;ll set this up... But I hope you know what you&#39;re doing.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We all do, Sev.&quot; Dusty said. &quot;We all do.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>That night, I tried to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t. All I could think of was Jin. The look of pain on his face when he was wounded. And the way he brushed it off. A simple &#39;I&#39;m fine&#39;. I didn&#39;t know why, but I held him in the greatest esteem for that. Maybe it&#39;s what Sev said about her and Jin. Maybe they are close friends, I thought. But I couldn&#39;t help but wonder.</p>\n\n<p>If I was honest with myself, I was too cowardly to face my feelings for Dusty. Maybe it was how terrified I was of being hurt. But most of all, it was how I saw myself that kept me from fighting for love. I knew I wasn&#39;t the best thing for Dusty. I was dangerous, and broken, and out of place. But sometimes I felt like Dusty would always be there to keep my demons in check. And that made me feel safe.</p>\n\n<p>I knew Jin was also a mostly quiet one. But there was something about his face that made me think he was a man of greater depth. That he had greater struggles, and had won them. And that maybe, in a way, we had a lot in common.</p>\n\n<p>After several hours of trying to rest, I gave up on sleep. I left my cabin and headed for the bridge. Olen was sitting in the pilot&#39;s chair. Dusty was in the co-pilot&#39;s seat. He was staring at the glass in front of him, at the empty space veiled by a purple and blue mist. I wondered how long he&#39;d been staring into the abyss. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is wrong?&quot; I asked. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;You know.&quot; He started. &quot;They say there&#39;s beast that haunts this nebula. Locals call it the Glathrax. They say its a demon, made of ice and darkness. A monster that stalks its prey and waits for them to be consumed by despair. Then he uses their sorrow to grow stronger.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Olen was more practical than him. &quot;It&#39;s a tall tale, Dusty. Give it up.&quot; She said. &quot;Besides, don&#39;t we have enough to worry about?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>We waited in silence for a moment, and I could see that Dusty was imagining the beast in front of him, fed by own despair. Finally he sighed, and spoke up. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. Yes I know.&quot; He said with an attempt at a smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Couldn&#39;t sleep?&quot; Sev, the determined engineer walked through the door of the bridge. I wondered if she slept at all. &quot;I&#39;ve rigged up the radiometer, it&#39;s ready to go. Should be able to get a reading on this panel here.&quot; She gestures to an area in the corner of the room. &quot;We&#39;ll be able to see if there&#39;s anything in range.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We spent that evening searching the nebula, haunting it like the legends of old. The Glathrax beast was nowhere to be found. But we sure did find enough ships to take our pick. We salvaged some supplies from the wrecks, and enough parts to get us out of the nebula and back to civilization. Which is exactly what we did.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>On Sabletide, it was a week of topping off our supplies and preparing ourselves for the next leg of our journey.</p>\n\n<p>The port was unlike you’d imagine for that is only found on pirate maps. A safe harbor for those who would do any deed for a profit? Indeed, there were pirates, smugglers and less than savory types, but there were also those who were trying to make an honest living. It had a certain village sense to it. It wasn&#39;t large, but there was a market, a tavern and a few small businesses and a proper work yard for spacecraft.</p>\n\n<p>And through all of that, the most important thing; the sea. The ocean. The place I had wished to set foot in ever since I was a little girl, looking up at the blue marble planet Ogma from a tiny dusty moon. I adored the water more than anything. The way it roiled, churned, and moved like a thing alive. They way the tide came in, and went out. The way the sun danced on its surface and turned it into a thousand different colors.</p>\n\n<p>And so, on the first day of Sabletide, I walked down to the docks, and I stared at the ocean. And I smiled.</p>\n\n<p>Once we got settled, Sevrea tracked down the crew from the <em>Pointe-Claire</em>. They had a doctor with them - Xasek was his name, an old friend of her&#39;s. He happily took on the task of stitching up Jin&#39;s wounds and sewing a proper splint for his arm.</p>\n\n<p>Jin gritted through the pain, and said nothing. But I could see the beads of sweat on his forehead, the way that his arm trembled as he held it. The doctor worked fast, and soon the ordeal was over.</p>\n\n<p>Xasek was a bit of an odd fellow. His face had crinkles at the corners, as if he smiled a lot, but his green eyes were always serious. He was older, a bit of a silver-haired grandfather type. His voice was strange, like a cross between the tones of two people speaking at once. It seemed he was good at his job, and the crew trusted him. As much as you could trust a pirate doctor, I suppose.</p>\n\n<p>The crew of the <em>Pointe-Claire</em> themselves were interesting to say the least. Solomon was the ship&#39;s captain. He had a fiery - but well intentioned personality. Like most pirates, he looked for all his officers to have a bit of steel about them. And several lya ago, he found it in our very own Sevrea. Solomon saw her as a bit of an outcast and decided to take her on his ship. It turned out to be a wise choice. She quickly proved herself indispensable. It helped that she was the only one who could work on the ship&#39;s engines.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the crew were specialists in their own rights, mostly from the Onania region, I&#39;m not sure where exactly.</p>\n\n<p>Mirabel, first&nbsp;mate. A woman of great skill in wide areas. She had a keen mind for tactical maneuvers, and a sharp eye for the stars. She was quiet, but frequently kept the rest of the crew in order. Her silence and her loyalty made her a great asset to the ship. </p>\n\n<p>There was a big fellow by the name of Morgan. Sev had told me that Morgan had once cut off his own hand in a fit of rage - and that he&#39;d somehow managed to reattach it. I didn&#39;t see his hand much during our time together, so can&#39;t say either way. Morgan ran the ships armory. The man had a mountain of a body, and was constantly in the armory when we&#39;d talk - either working on weapons, or sharpening the stakes and blades.</p>\n\n<p>Also aboard was Abner. None of us could quite figure him out. He was peculiar. Olen called him a <em>shadow man</em>. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what that meant, but I had a feeling it wasn&#39;t good. He had a look about him that made you think he&#39;d seen far too many horrible things in his past. Not sure what he did aboard the <em>Pointe-Claire</em>, if anything. He was usually taking apart some piece of machinery or other, and I&#39;d see Sev or Olen looking over whatever he&#39;d put together. I got the idea that Abner must&#39;ve been an engineer of sorts.</p>\n\n<p>There was a boy named Erwin. Young fellow, no more than 14. Captain Solomon took him in when he realized he&#39;d accidentally killed his father, and had nowhere else to go. Erwin was a good kid. He helped out where-ever he could, and was often seen stacking crates or barrels and even helping Morgan in the armory. He was a bit of a handful, but a good kid and Sev liked him.</p>\n\n<p>Last of all was the navigator, who went by the name of Fati. There weren&#39;t many navigators who could read the stars like Fati. She could make it seem like she was speaking with them. But she had a different skill than most navigators. While she could still read the stars to find her way, her talent came in the form of divination. She would look into her glass and predict the future. Weather, or a flight path, or where a pirate&#39;s treasure may lie - she could tell you.</p>\n\n<p>We were to stay in port for a week or so. Jin was on the mend. He was able to hobble about on his crutches, so at least he could do something other than sit in his cabin. He wanted to work, even as he was still recovering from his wounds. But most of us saw that it was only a matter of time until he was back to being active. We would need him.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Both the crews of <em>Normandie</em> and <em>Pointe Claire</em> were in high spirits. We ate and drank a place called the White Raven. It was a cozy, dim joint, with a good selection of ales. One drink in particular, called Revri, was especially popular here. It was known for its deep color and rich flavor, but also for being notoriously hard to stomach. I could see why as I tried it. But it seemed to be the order of the evening. So we all drank it up, and made merry.</p>\n\n<p>The night wore on, and as it went on, the stories the crews told grew increasingly fanciful. Most of it was made up nonsense that was laughed at by the other patrons in the bar. But some of it was worthy of being passed down to history.</p>\n\n<p>At one point in the night, a song broke out. An old song, a song of the sea, one to be sung from your heart.</p>\n\n<p>Let us hoist the sails,</p>\n\n<p>Hear the Captains call,</p>\n\n<p>We will brave the gale,</p>\n\n<p>And the wrath of squall,</p>\n\n<p>By the last ship home,</p>\n\n<p>For a gallon of rum,</p>\n\n<p>Out o’ the storm we&#39;ll come!</p>\n\n<p>The place thundered with music and song. The two captains stood on the bar and on tables and on stools leading the singing crowd. Each encouraging their respective crews. Their drinks sloshing, their words spilling. I was surprised to find myself joining in, not fully knowing the words. Yet singing with them was contagious. As the songs of the old sea filled the air, I found myself swept away on waves of the purest of emotions - hope, resolution, the sea.</p>\n\n<p>I looked around the room at all the rowdy star sailors celebrating. Dusty, Sev, Olen, Jin. I pondered where it was that they&#39;d been, where they were going. Whether they knew some secret about how to really live. I realized then that these characters are real. These people who embody risk and adventure. Who live their lives for the lust of the stars. I contemplated how far they had traveled, how deep they had fallen into the bottomless ocean of wonder.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to swim in that ocean, to find out how deep it might go.</p>\n\n<h1>7</h1>\n\n<p>&quot;And that&#39;s it?&quot; I asked. I couldn&#39;t believe what Dusty had just said.</p>\n\n<p>We were sitting in the cramped bridge of <em>Normandie Place</em>, Olen was checking charts. Jin and Sevrea were elsewhere on the ship, preparing for our departure. &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; He replied, as he sat down.</p>\n\n<p>I snatched the handwritten letter from his hand. His uncle, Licor Scoma, an influential political figure on Port Bethany, had offered to settle all debts with what was left of Greem&#39;s gang.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, Greem&#39;s financier, a crime boss named Bilge, owed Scoma a great deal of money. Bilge also hated Greem. He thought he was a liar and a thief, and he was. They both were. Hell of a team they made.</p>\n\n<p>Greem never told his boss what I found because he didn&#39;t know what it was. At least not until I killed him with it. Either way, Greem was going to keep it for himself. Eventually word got to the Scoma family when they discovered that his nephew, Dusty, was involved in Greem&#39;s death.</p>\n\n<p>The deal was simple, Licor Scoma would settle all of my debts, the lion&#39;s share being the cost of Greem&#39;s ship I happened to destroy, and the new underboss to replace him would be someone in the Scoma family. it didn&#39;t cost Licor anything out of pocket. Instead, it was a perfect opportunity to build ties with the crime syndicates on the Scoret Coast as the Athylian Empire tightened control of the core systems.</p>\n\n<p>I was shocked. But, naturally, there was a catch. I now owed a huge debt to the Scoma Family. But, at least I wouldn&#39;t have Bilge or Greem&#39;s gang chasing me halfway across the galaxy and back.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well?&quot; Dusty said with half a smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I–Thank you.&quot; I hugged him. He wasn&#39;t expecting it. We embraced for a moment until my mind caught up with my heart.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I will find a way to repay your family.&quot; I nodded. I was wiping tears from my face. I was relieved but also terrified about owing so much to such a powerful criminal family. I needed to be careful of getting to close.</p>\n\n<p>Taking it all in, took a seat in the old leather chair behind Olen, plotting some navigation charts. The letter was still in my hand.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; He asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I haven&#39;t decided.&quot; I know my tone was abrupt. I didn&#39;t mean it that way. I had to think. I didn&#39;t have a home anymore. At least, not one I wanted ever to see again. I couldn&#39;t go back to Baysia, not with how I left things with Greem&#39;s gang and the breakers. Maybe it was better I started over again. Maybe I would go to one of the core worlds, to Athylia itself. I felt a strong urge to leave, to move on, though my options were limited. I couldn&#39;t go back to Baysia or the Scoret Coast.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why not sail with us?&quot; Olen asked. I had nearly forgotten she was there. She looked up from her work and turned to be from her chair.</p>\n\n<p>It occurred to me. I could stay aboard. Maybe then I&#39;d be able to save enough to repay his uncle. After all, this place was starting to feel like a new home. The crew and I bonded over the last week, and Jin doesn&#39;t hate me for getting him nearly killed. It would be a fresh start.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I couldn&#39;t… &quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Olen asked. &quot;You&#39;re a good enough sailor. And you&#39;re a good shot. We could use someone like you. You&#39;re resourceful.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>At first I thought she was kidding. I was persuaded by her smile, that genuine smile that made her eyes light up. &quot;What about the crew?&quot; I asked. &quot;Don&#39;t they have a say?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They&#39;ll be glad to have you.&quot; She grinned.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I –&quot; I stammered and looked at Dusty.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Will you sail under my command?&quot; Dusty asked, in a formal but somewhat playful way.</p>\n\n<p>I thought for a moment. I nodded, then shrugged with a smile. &quot;Yes. But, only until I can repay your uncle.&quot; I said as I stood up.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very well. Second engineer, it is then. Ms. Abeona see to it that our newest engineer is given her first assignment.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Aye, aye, sir.&quot; Olen replied.</p>\n\n<p>After a beat, &quot;Now get&nbsp;back to work, the both of you!&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>I chuckled. &quot;Aye, Captain.&quot; Not well-versed life aboard, I stood there awkwardly. Thankfully Olen hinted as she shooed me away with her hands, mouthing, &quot;Go. Go.&quot; I departed the bridge as a crew member of the <em>Normandie</em>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>After the week on Sabletide, I didn&#39;t want to leave. I had fallen in love with this place. I wished to call it home. The sea air, the sound of the waves on the old wooden docks. The small, tight-knit but welcoming community. We were all outcasts here, whether it was because we wanted to be one or not. We were outsiders by necessity. All of us were determined to defy the systems and to get what we needed, in whatever way possible.</p>\n\n<p>I knew staying was impossible, though. It wasn&#39;t a place to settle, nor to call home. It was a place to flock and leave. Like a summer romance gone wrong, I had to move on. Not unlike how most privateer crews came and went, the people of this place also came and went. I felt a sense of endearment for these people and this place – like I&#39;d been here before, even though I hadn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>The evening before we departed, the <em>Pointe-Claire</em> crew came to say farewell and offer congratulations on our newest crew member, myself. There was wine, and rum. We laughed at the stories captain Solomon told about Dusty and Sev. Some of them made me more nervous than others.</p>\n\n<p>Jin cooked up a big meal of fresh seafood. Erwin had befriended a fisherman&#39;s son aboard the <em>L&#39;Immaculée</em> and had brought back an entire basket of fresh fish, along with crab and clams. There was also some wild fowl called Trilluck and a good deal of wine. </p>\n\n<p>The crew dined on soft land beneath of the ship, and captain Solomon made a toast: &quot;Ladies, and gentleman, adventurers, refugees, and potential pirates. I&#39;d like to make a toast, if I may. To the crew of the <em>Normandie Place</em>, and to their newest member, Amal. To the friends of the past, to the friends of today, and to the friends yet to come.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Aye!&quot; The crew cheered. Jin and Dusty picked up Erwin and bobbing him about in the air he squealed with glee. I picked up my glass and drank deeply. The wine was sour and strange, but I didn&#39;t mind.</p>\n\n<p>The night went late, and the crew carried on with drinking and stories. Morgan initiated a one handed push-up competition. Unexpectedly, he lost to Sev, and with Olen on her back none the less. The doctor was the judge, although in this case, the winner was all but too obvious. The crowd roared as Sev lifted herself from the ground and Morgan who was twice her size, collapsed in a heap. I expected her to gloat. Instead, she put an arm around his shoulder and said &quot;Morgan, you big lug. You almost had me there.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I laughed at the scene, secretly jealous of Sev&#39;s good humor. She was one of those people who could do anything and it didn&#39;t bother her. I spent most of that night talking with the crew of the <em>Pointe-Claire</em>. Morgan was partial to showing me his tattoos, and Isabel showed me how to play a card game called <em>Crossbones</em>. I was terrible at it, but I had a good time.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; Said Isabel with a smile, as I lost my tenth game. She winked at me and blew Morgan a kiss.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I think I need some air.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What? You&#39;re just starting to have fun!&quot; Morgan said, putting his arm around me. I shrugged him off.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m fine. I just need to clear my head.&quot; I excused myself.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to see the ocean one last time. I finished my wine and slipped out of the ship and onto the landing area where we had spent the last week. It was an area close to the shore, a broad and flat sandy spit of land where you could hear the nearby ocean. Driftwood and stones littered the ground, and next to us was the <em>Pointe-Claire</em>. She was more massive, newer, and more powerful.</p>\n\n<p>Several other ships berthed here as well, each with crews and lives and stories of their own. That night, they were out of their vessels conversing over campfires, making plans or trading wares, or practicing Orylian lute. It was friendly and calm. We were all nomads, and this was the one place we could count on as being home. Had I told you I&#39;d be going to a planet that&#39;s only on secret pirate maps, you would not have imagined how deeply comforting it was.</p>\n\n<p>From the loading ramp of <em>Normandie</em>, I stepped onto the sandy grass, barefooted. It was a warm night, a tropical twilight settled above. Abner was outside the <em>Pointe-Claire</em>, smoking and speaking with Fati. He waved. I responded with a clumsy gesture as I left the landing lights of <em>Normandie</em> I wondered if they could tell that I&#39;d been drinking.</p>\n\n<p>I continued towards the sound of the ocean, walking on the sandy spit. The boisterous crew&#39;s sound wained, and Fati left Abner to finish his cigarette to join me. With her was a small lantern. Maybe she thought I needed it or would stumble.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;May I join you, Amal?&quot; She asked. She was soft-spoken, thin, and much older than I. She seemed wise, like a person who had more than a lifetime of wisdom and experience. Maybe it was the wine; maybe I was trying to think nice things about someone I hardly knew.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course Fati. Thank you for bringing the light.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Not at all.&quot; She stretched out both of her arms to the band of the night. &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful night.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; The waves were beautiful. They were powerful but calm. The water was lapping on the beach and on the rocks that jutted out into the sea. Abner and <em>Pointe-Claire</em> was entirely out of my sight. I was alone with Fati and the sound of the waves. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is the most beautiful place I&#39;ve ever been.&quot; I said. It was the wine talking, but I didn&#39;t care. I wouldn&#39;t remember this.</p>\n\n<p>Fati was quiet. She had a smile on her face. Perhaps enjoying the moment as well. We walked for a few moments in comfortable silence. The sky was clear, and around us, the stars and galaxy sparkled brightly. The sun had set behind the shore leaving a dull purple glow clinging to the ocean. I&#39;d missed all that in my time in the darkness of space.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Fati. Is it true, you are a seer?&quot; I said. The wine was catching up to me and my words felt stupidly bold.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; She said, was her simple answer.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Then tell me. What of my future? What can you see?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>She turned to me and simply smiled and looked into my eyes, though I could barely make them out. I felt a chill in my stomach. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mm?&quot; I asked, smiling nervously.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come.&quot; She said as she turned and led the way, gripping close to the lantern to keep us from stumbling. We stepped over a long piece of grey driftwood. &quot;Here.&quot; She said. &quot;Right here.&quot; We were standing at the edge of the water, my feet sinking into the wet sand. The cool waves lapped at my bare toes. She was looking up. Her grey hair shined in the blue and red light of the speckled sky above. &quot;Look up.&quot; She urged me.</p>\n\n<p>Fati leaned down over the sea. Her long hair drifted in the wind. Her soft lips were parted, her same grey eyes gazing off calmly over the water. She took a deep breath. As she did so, I saw the shimmer of tiny stars behind her. Her face was up, against the night sky, but her eyes were closed. I heard her exhale one last time, then begin to whisper. I could not understand her language. But, I knew she spoke in words of magic. I could feel it in the air. I got the sense that she was speaking old words, ancient one. Words from a time before the gods. I was transfixed, as much by her presence as by her power.</p>\n\n<p>In the my drunken twilight I wasn&#39;t sure if all of this was real. I could hardly understand the words but I could feel them. She opened her eyes, and with her index finger pointed out over the shimmering sea. I followed her hand&#39;s direction as she stirred a patch of bright stars. &quot;Lightning. Swords. I see a soldier, a leader. A fearsome one, stronger than stone.&quot; She closed her eyes tight. &quot;And you. I see you. In place you didn&#39;t expect to be, in a life you might not have expected to be living.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A life? Who will I be?&quot; I was tipsy and spoke too strongly. I wanted to know. I needed to know.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here.&quot; Her finger pointed up, tracing a shape in the sky. I followed it with my eyes. &quot;There will be the pains of being a warrior and a terrible choice you must make.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What will I choose?&quot; I breathed, now facing the sea. The air had stilled, a hush descended upon us. As if everything was waiting for her next words.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot; She said as she joined me, looking at the breaking waves with her sage eyes. &quot;Not everything is certain in your future, Amal.&quot; We stood together for a moment, watching the night. It had grown darker and the once purple sky had turned a deep indigo. The stars had brightened and moved, dancing between the thickening clouds above.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ve already made your choice.&quot; Her voice was sombre, mysterious. She touched my arm. &quot;We should return before the others worry.&quot; She said as I nodded. We turned and began to walk back along the sea&#39;s edge, her long hair I had noticed earlier, now trailing down her back against the wind. We found <em>Pointe-Claire</em> untouched by the night, her lanterns providing yellow light. Calm. Safe.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll remember.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>We returned to our&nbsp;ships. I would later discover Fati was a Riff, a species as old as time who could speak the ancient tongue of Rifat. Her visions were not charlatans tricks or illusions. Her predictions were a gift, a genuine ability that could be trained and honed. She could not see everything, just events that were already set in motion. And that the Riff are exceptionally rare in the galaxy, but they are not extinct. And she would be one of the last of her kind.</p>\n\n<p>I would not see her again.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>We set off from Sabletide. Bound for the rimward border territories, I was the newest member of the crew. Our destination: Tyrus. A free world and the capital of the Rim Territory Alliance. It was the furthest from the core worlds I&#39;ve ever been, at the very edge of the the border zone. To get there, we had to go through the Rim Trade Way. Even for the fastest ships, it would be at least a several week-long voyage from the core worlds.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its distance, the Athylian Empire has little presence in the border territories. The Athylians view The Rim territory as a galactic backwater, of little strategic importance. So, the territories are relatively independent. These worlds have fully formed governments, and some administer their own militaries. However, none of the border territories are safe from crime. In particular, Tyrus has long run into problems with piracy, and <em>Normandie Place</em> wasn&#39;t about to make their problems any better. </p>\n\n<p>The Rim Alliance attempts to keep order through the trade way through their massive space station. It serves as a meeting hub for merchant vessels and traders alike. It sits at the intersection of two major trade routes, the Rim Trade Way and the Border Route. Beyond the Border, lies the Great Expanse, an endless and uncharted region. Not only do Imperial star charts end at this border, all star charts end at this border.</p>\n\n<p>No maps exist of what&#39;s further than a cycle&#39;s journey past the border. This region of space is treacherous and alien, and is unknown to space faring vessels. This place is where the legends and myth of fantastical alien worlds come from. It&#39;s the farthest place in the galaxy, and it&#39;s frontier is wild and unknowable.</p>\n\n<p>There are dark rumors about things that lurk beyond the rimward border. A man I once knew claimed to have been there. He had gone mad, stricken with a sickness and driven insane by the unending depths of the void. He spoke in riddles of things beyond what we know, dreadful things, things that crawled out of the deepest inky-black depths of space. Some were horrible, insatiable monsters, blind and hungry and without mercy.</p>\n\n<p>He spoke of others that were incomprehensible. Ancient forces of chaos and destruction – too terrifying to name. The man raved of the things that haunted his dreams, that tore away at his sanity. He died in the shadows of those stories, taking his secrets with him. I have no doubt that there are horrors that the universe holds, but I had never heard stories such as his. Anyone who&#39;s traveled to the border territories has heard one story or another.</p>\n\n<p>After sailing close for several cycles, we parted ways with the <em>Pointe-Claire</em>. They wished us well, and good fortune at the rim. Their ship headed spinward, bound for the rock of Yokan, a resource rich world near the heart of the Imperial space. <em>Normandie Place</em> set course for the distant Tyrus system.</p>\n\n<p>The voyage to Tyrus took five weeks. During that time, I had a chance to get to know the crew, and the ship, although I kept the Dusty Hammond at arm&#39;s length. Maybe it was the fact that I was a member of the crew now, or perhaps it was my newly acquired debt to his family, but I felt I needed to keep my distance. Although occasionally, I thought back to my first night aboard. I wondered how things would have played out if I hadn&#39;t rebuffed him. If I had yielded to his charm, or I had let him into my bed.</p>\n\n<p>As for the others, I bonded with Sevrea and Jin. Olen was distant, but not unfriendly. I felt more and more comfortable with the crew as the days went on. I hoped that maybe, they would consider me a friend. They were good people, and so far, none of them acted like the jack-booted thugs the Athylians would want you to think they were. They were people — pirates, yes, but they didn&#39;t seem like the kind one might expect.</p>\n\n<p>It is a strange thing when you start to trust people that are very different from you. You begin to learn more about yourself, rather than them. I spoke more with Sevrea; she told me that she came from Riga. Born in an industrial city on the Dalacara Gulf, a port that spilled over the great planet&#39;s eastern oceans. There she learned the trades and worked as a machinist — she had a rare skill with machine parts and engines. She would became a mechanic for a small-time smuggling operation, which eventually led her to <em>Pointe Claire</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Sev was a woman that didn&#39;t apologize for the things she believed in. I admired her for the way she stood up for herself and for the things she thought were right. She was proud and strong, bold enough to speak her mind and to challenge anyone who disagreed with her. She was a good person to have at your side – to share a drink with, or to watch your back in a fight.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;d also become my closest friend aboard the ship. We spent hours talking about the things we&#39;d seen, the things that had happened to us. She told me stories about her life on Riga, how she used to visit her father&#39;s fishing boats on the gulf, how she had once nearly been lost overboard. How the disaster that befell her life began when her father caught a horrible illness that stole his hearing. She told me about the war and the Athylian occupation of her homeworld that lasted for years. How the captain of <em>Pointe Claire</em>, Solomon Kamara took her in when she had nowhere else to go.</p>\n\n<p>We made stops at a few worlds on the outward voyage, to trade, refuel, and of course, make some extra coin along the way. We did a few cargo pickups and even delivered a small shipment of goods to Pavo IV, a hidden gem in the Trimac system. We negotiated a fair price, although, as a band of pirates, we naturally bargained with our hands on our holsters, rather than haggling over figures on a sheet of paper as honest traders might do.</p>\n\n<p>The days stretched out into weeks and the weeks into nearly a month. It had been a long time since I last felt comfortable in a group. It was surreal. I was used to being alone, living only for myself. The time spent as a member of <em>Normandie Place</em> had already changed me. I started to feel like I had a home, and with that came a sense of pride. A sense of belonging that I had never experienced before.</p>\n\n<p>We worked hard and shipboard life was grueling, but it was a good living. We were tough and took care of each other. I learned to trust them, and they in turn, took care of me. I did my best to do my part and pull my own weight. I did my share of the dirty work and I didn&#39;t complain. I held my own in a fight and I kept a smile on my face during the good times. I was determined to earn my place on the crew, even if I was a stranger. They could&#39;ve easily treated me like an outsider, that woman that nobody knew, or cared to know.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I was treated with respect.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty-six days after we left <em>Pointe-Claire</em>, <em>Normandie Place</em> reached The Rim Trading Station to resupply, before the quick jump to Tyrus. There, we&#39;d find why we&#39;d come to the galactic edge.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s not stealing if we&#39;re stealing something that&#39;s already been stolen,&quot; Dusty said, sipping a glass of something brown. We were aboard the bustling trading station, having arrived a day earlier. Dusty sat with his back to an old table and I sat next to him. We surveyed the room. Sevrea and Jin were laying out a game of cards, Olen sat quietly, her eyes shifting.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s just call it what it is,&quot; Sevrea said, as she dealt out some cards. She seemed to have already made up her mind.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, what is it we&#39;re <em>not</em> stealing?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Transponder codes.&quot; He said. &quot;Codes the empire uses to track ships between systems.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The way I heard it, a creature named Jegava got his hands on a pile of unencrypted ones. And apparently, somebody on Kelisia wants them. Bad.&quot; They were most certainly stolen by Jegava, probably from someone who stole them from the colonial shipyard on Cevos Prime.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So, what&#39;s the catch?&quot; Jin asked. He was keeping an eye out for anyone listening, with <em>Mordred</em> in his lap.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No catch,&quot; Dusty said, leaning back. &quot;Bit a family obligation. We get the codes from Jegava, and bring them to my uncle&#39;s contact on Port Bethany, leaving with our pockets stuffed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sounds fair,&quot; Jin said, as he picked up a hand of cards. He adjusted his leg, wincing. He&#39;d had it tended to at the station, but I thought it was still bothering him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do you think?&quot; Sevrea asked.</p>\n\n<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &quot;Your uncle seem to get his hands on some interesting things,&quot; I said, watching the others play cards.</p>\n\n<p>He picked up another card, and smiled at me. &quot;What can I say? He&#39;s connected.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That was an understatement. Dusty&#39;s uncle, although still a crime boss, was on the cusp of becoming much more. The family was looking to grow their power and had their eyes set beyond Breehl and Port Bethany. And they were looking at the Athylian Royalty as potential allies.</p>\n\n<p>The station was a hive of activity and buzzed with activity. From our vantage point in the extravagant bar, we could see the main market square, the reception room where ships would first come in, and other small rooms where deals were made. it was all fairly modern, clean, and bustling. The tables, chairs, and even the very wood of the bar were solid and sturdy. There were hundreds of people, maybe thousands, milling around. Talking, arguing, trading, smuggling, and doing just about everything else one could think of. Dusty said it was one of the busiest trading stations he had ever been to, and he had been to a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. &quot;I don&#39;t get it, why doesn&#39;t Jegava take them to the Scoma&#39;s himself? What’s so special about this book?&quot; she asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;See, the thing of it is, Jegava doesn&#39;t want anyone to know that he has it. If the Rim Alliance finds out,&quot; He took another sip, &quot;The entire trade-way will be looking for him, and the family wants to keep this one quiet.&quot; Decrypted codes could let you slip through imperial space undetected. They could be worth a fortune. This needed to be handled discretely, but knowing Dusty, that might be a challenge. &quot;We play it smart, no trouble, and that&#39;s that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea looked like she was chewing on the idea. &quot;Huh, okay,&quot; She said finally, pulling her cards in close. &quot;What&#39;s in it for us?&quot; She folded her hand of cards.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ten thousand,&quot; Dusty said flatly.</p>\n\n<p>When he heard the amount, Jin nearly choked on his drink. &quot;TEN?!–&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Olen cut him off. &quot;Keep it down, Jin!&quot; She said gesturing with his eyes at the groups of people nearby.</p>\n\n<p>That was more than a little enticing. It would mean a significant payday for the crew. It wasn&#39;t enough to retire on, but with the money I&#39;d make on the trip, it would undoubtedly make a dent in the debt I owed the Scoma&#39;s. But, something puzzled me. Why would an imperial colony need to buy stolen imperial locator codes from a crime boss like Dusty&#39;s uncle? They had something they were trying to hide. Nobody on the level needed cracked codes. What could be worth that much money? Something didn’t add up.</p>\n\n<p>Olen dealt another hand trying to keep things as quiet as possible. As far as I could tell, no one else in the room was paying attention to us. But you can never be too sure. I kept my eyes open.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well, I guess we&#39;ve got ourselves an adventure,&quot; Sevrea finally said, laying her cards on the table.</p>\n\n<p>Jin also laid his hand down, followed by Olen. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;So we&#39;re on?&quot; Dusty asked. He pulled a single card from his hand, laid it down, and picked another from the pile. He then looked at each of us. Of course we were going to do it. I had a debt to pay, and the crew was in need of a big payday. I looked at Sevrea, she nodded her head. The rest of the crew agreed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea took her winnings and leaned back in her chair. &quot;I suppose we&#39;re going to have to drink to that,&quot; she said as she finished off her glass of brown liquid. She called for drinks for all of us. She rolled her glass around in her hands and looked at us, &quot;This is going to be interesting,&quot; she said.</p>\n\n<p>The group looked at each other, smiled, and took care of their glasses as well.</p>\n\n<p>I called out, &quot;Another game?&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>A day later, the crew traveled to the wet, swampy world of Tyrus. There, on the outskirts of the city of Aditi, we were set for the meeting with Jegava. The place is a watery world. As soon as we walked off the ship, we met the humidity and muggy air that plagued everything. Jin hated it. Sev loved it.</p>\n\n<p>Inside, the old mechanic&#39;s shop was largely empty, save a few crates and some tools. I kept an eye out. Things are not always as they seem. Dusty, Sev, Jin, and I exchanged glances. We were a little tenser than we should have been. </p>\n\n<p>An old swap creature moved out of the shadows. It stood at seven feet tall, covered in brown leathery skin and a multitude of scales. Sharp spines sprouted from its head, arms, and legs, ready to cut the unwary.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Good. You&#39;re here.&quot; He said. His voice was a deep slur, &quot;That leaves us only with the price.&quot; The creature placed a long-fingered, bony hand on a table. His fingers slithered over a small, leather-bound book.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Fifty thousand.&quot; He said, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find that a fair price.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Jegava immediately realized things weren&#39;t going to go his way when Sev drew her firearm in one motion and racked it. Jegava&#39;s expression remained unchanged, even with a piece pointed at him. He didn&#39;t flinch or seem to care.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re not here to buy.&quot; Sev said, her pistol trained on him, &quot;We&#39;re here to take it.&quot; She kept the safety off. Sev was a graceful woman, but she closed in on being downright terrifying at moments like this.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ohohoho,&quot; he laughed in a gruff voice, &quot;Hammond. I should have known not to deal with you.&quot; He paused; his eyes grew narrow. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Jegava. Nice to see you again. Now, give the book up, and we&#39;ll be on our way.&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re a snake. Always cheating someone out of money. And your scheming family–&quot; Jegava spat, &quot;A disgrace. You&#39;re a fool. You think you can come here and take what&#39;s mine.&quot; He glanced over at Jin. &quot;All of you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Jegava laughed again.</p>\n\n<p>I stepped forward with my hand on my hostler, &quot;Enough. The book.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oho,&quot; Jegava rumbled. &quot;And who are you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the creature in the eyes and drew <em>Reason to Believe</em>. His eyes then shifted to the lustrous firearm in front of him. He studied the barrel and its form as if he&#39;d seen a weapon it before. He stopped dead for a moment as the sick smile died on his face. The pause in the conversation was tense. Only the distant sound of water seeping through the roof could be heard.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Sev asked, lowering her pistol slightly. &quot;I got this.&quot; She said, licking her lips. She was telling me to back off. I did not.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I stated, &quot;The book. Now.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>His face contorted, and his eyes narrowed. The creature looked at Dusty, then at me, deeply. &quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re doing,&quot; he said with his tongue eeling over his dry lips. Jegava tossed the book in my direction. It fell to the ground, skittering across the wooden planks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Good luck.&quot; He snorted. &quot;And don&#39;t let me catch you on this planet again.&quot; Before we could respond, he roared and disappeared into the shadows. We heard a short scuffle, then splashing, then silence.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea took the book and stuffed it into her jacket. &quot;All right,&quot; She said, holstering her pistol, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We dashed out of the old warehouse, splashing through the occasional puddle and the thick humidity, towards our ship. The city of Aditi was quiet, and the rain seemed to have kept most of the citizens indoors.</p>\n\n<p>After we&#39;d trudged through the muck of several city blocks. &quot;I hate this place,&quot; Jin muttered. &quot;I&#39;m glad we&#39;re leaving.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Soaking wet, and muddied we proceeded to <em>Normandie Place</em>. Olen had been keeping watch. &quot;Any trouble?&quot; she asked. Olen always had a good handle on things, and it made me feel safe to see her on the lookout for us.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Got it,&quot; Sev said, falling into a chair, unlacing her dirty boots. She placed the old book on the navigator&#39;s table on the bridge.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And Jegava?&quot; Olen asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No trouble,&quot; Sev said, shaking her head and pulling her boots off. Her pistol was wet. She placed it on the table next to the book.</p>\n\n<p>To me, it was strange. A gangster such as Jegava, with no fight left in him? Something was off. But, who cares? We got the book, and now we were safe.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thanks to Amal, he gave up without a fight.&quot; Her voice was sarcastic, twinged with annoyance.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at her, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; I tried to be polite.</p>\n\n<p>She pulled a muddy boot off, &quot;I could have, and should have, handled it. I didn&#39;t need your help.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I looked at her, startled at the tone she was taking. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I asked but didn&#39;t get a response before Olen intervened.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Leave it,&quot; Olen said to both of us as if to cut off the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m off,&quot; Sev said, grabbing her boots and headed to her cabin. </p>\n\n<p>I looked over at Dusty, but he only shrugged, looking back at me as if to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I scratched my cheek, sitting back in the chair.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Olen said, seemingly reading in the look of uncertainty I had.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well. We bought some time, but that&#39;s about it.&quot; Jin said. The tension was still heavy in the room. No one quite knew how to talk to one another, and we were all awkward and tense.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty spoke, wiping his brow dry from the rain. &quot;Jin&#39;s right. Jegava won&#39;t be shy about what happened.&quot; He then turned the navigator, Olen. &quot;Rig for departure,&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; Olen replied, hopping to her station.</p>\n\n<p>I looked out the small port-hole by the helm. Water dripped from the outside of the glass. Tyrus brought us no trouble, save for Jin&#39;s ill fitment to the swampy world, but the journey to Port Bethany would be different. Jegava was well connected to The Rim territory&#39;s criminal underworld. There was no telling what he&#39;d do. He could easily let half the sector know in the next few hours. If he wanted. I thought about why he&#39;d given up so quickly. A gangster such as he was a tough nut to crack. Why give up?</p>\n\n<p>What then was the purpose of the book? Why give it to us? I then felt a deep chill.</p>\n\n<p>Jin turned left the bridge, snorting about a hot shower. The others followed suit, each carrying their conversation as they slopped off the bridge. Still muddy and damp, I sat at the navigator&#39;s table and looked at the leather-bound book. Dusty mumbled something about wondering why it&#39;s so valuable as he departed the bridge deck, my eyes transfixed upon its cover. With the bridge empty and quiet, I reached for the book.</p>\n\n<p>It was a strange, old thing. I studied it for a moment until my curiosity got the best of me. </p>\n\n<p>I opened the book slowly and was met with handwriting. Not like any I&#39;d seen or written before. It was a sort of ancient language. The script was intricate, so perfectly calligraphed, that one would have never suspected it to be human. The sprawled letters seemed to cascade from the book&#39;s spine.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What?&quot; I whispered aloud, my eyes spellbound to the yellowed pages. I could tell instantly why Jegava had agreed to submit so readily. There was something ominous about the book. A terrible presence that weighed down my being. I was afraid, but I had to see. I had to know what was in it.</p>\n\n<p>As I touched the page, the hairs on my neck rose. I should have left the thing alone. There was trouble here. I was sure of it. But my curiosity destroyed all rationality. Curious, I proceeded to look, letting my eyes trace along the ink.</p>\n\n<p>Text, unknown symbols and depictions of ancient geometry, illustrations of strange creatures filled the pages. Eccentric patterns were drawn in some areas, old symbols of power, and I had no idea what they meant. Was this a codebook for pirate captains? I began to doubt it.</p>\n\n<p>The symbols were foreign to me, but there was an undeniable feeling of familiarity. A distinct pattern, a sense of recognition ran through my mind as I studied it. I felt as if I had seen something like this before. But where?</p>\n\n<p>I looked about the empty room, ensuring I was alone. An idea seemed to form in my mind, and a smile formed on my lips.</p>\n\n<p>I drew my sidearm and held its markings against the glyphs in the book. I could almost feel them mesh together like magnets, slowly aligning. They felt warm to the touch as if they were coming alive. Some of the markings began to change their forms.</p>\n\n<p>The book&#39;s pages – they were coming to life. My heart raced as if a fly were beating against my ribcage. Through time and wear, text grew fresh and vibrant. I continued to align the book&#39;s markings to my firearm&#39;s ancient markings. Then, as if it all clicked, the symbols stopped moving and set as if they were in stone. The characters had unraveled, and a new language had formed. One of which I understood without knowing how or why. I read the words of the cover <em>Grimoire of Sutro Dek-ratu</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What had we stolen? What had we found? I was terrified. I was exhilarated. I was in fear. I surveyed the room. At once, I became aware of my heartbeat. I noticed it was distant. Yet, just above the steady thud of life, another sound seemed to rise, floating above the drone of the engines and the ship. A voice. A voice from the book.</p>\n\n<p>It purred, soft, and seductive. It whispered, deep, and dark. It sang from beyond the vale. It was beautiful. It told the law of the jungle: survival was rooted in chaos. I heard its haunted lullaby; I heard its ruthless promises. I heard its scorn for my existence.</p>\n\n<p>It sang of my death and the death of those I had come to care for. This was a book of tremendous evil and unthinkable power. This was a book like no other: an ancient tome from beyond the void, an unknown artifact from banished worlds. An absurdity of untold terror. </p>\n\n<p>I didn’t know it at the time, but the Empire had been searching for this book for centuries. They had known of its existence and its power, but had never been able to find it.</p>\n\n<p> And now, here it was, in my hands.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at the mysterious book in my hands, I felt a sense of unease and uncertainty. I had always trusted Dusty and the rest of the crew, but now I wasn&#39;t so sure. I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Dusty was hiding something from me, and the thought made me uneasy. I felt as if the book had somehow awakened something inside me, making me more attuned to the dangers around us. I didn&#39;t know what the book was or what it did, but I knew that it was important and that we needed to figure it out. I just hoped that we would be ready for whatever came next.</p>\n\n<h1>8</h1>\n\n<p>The cold bit into us like a wolf into a lamb, making us feel its teeth. A thin layer of snow blanketed the ground of Kelesia, covering the grass and turning the underbrush into a white landscape. I rubbed my hands together, nipping at my fingers, as I waited for our buyer. The book frightened me, and I was eager to be rid of it.</p>\n\n<p>The frozen starport of Carit sparkled in the falling snow, littered with frozen ships and vessels. Everywhere I looked, I saw freighters, transports and corvettes – some new and shiny, others with the wear and tear of many voyages. An old freighter, donated to the Imperial Navy, was tethered to a landing pad, as if it were a relic of days past. Across the way was a ferry freshly docked. There was no sign of our buyer or the other passengers – only footprints that disappeared in the snow.</p>\n\n<p>From somewhere, a hound appeared, its breath fogging in the cold air as it scurried over. The thick fur on its neck and legs was a tuft of grey and black, along its back it was white. Its tail was a fluff of fur with a dark tip that curved like a scimitar.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah, he is a handsome one,&quot; Jin said, a smile on his lips. We watched it nose the snowy ground as it moved along. Glancing up and down, it seemed to be searching for something. Jin, reaching his hand out, held it closed. &quot;Here, boy. Come here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The hound let out a small whine before slowly waddling over, a little unsure of the man in front of him. It sniffed Jin&#39;s hand as he opened it, revealing a small chunk of bread. &quot;There you are.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The dog snatched the bread out of Jin&#39;s hand, then bolted off towards the edge of the starport like a streak of grey fur.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s the least I can do,&quot; Jin said, pulling his coat tightly around him. &quot;Besides, dogs ward off bad luck.&quot; He looked at me quizzically, &quot;Don&#39;t they?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As he spoke, there was a loud thud and clang coming from Normandie. We watched as a figure emerged, their body covered in overalls and an apron that had seen better days. Severa carried a toolbox with her as she popped onto the low slung wing of the ship. She didn&#39;t look very happy, or warm.</p>\n\n<p>Away she worked, tending to the still healing wounds our ship had collected since long before Tyrus.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Any word from Dusty?&quot; I asked Jin, my thoughts returning to our captain.</p>\n\n<p>Jin shook his head, bundled in a thick coat with snowflakes adorning his hat.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I have a bad feeling about that book, Jin,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As do I,&quot; he said, rubbing his large hands together to warm them up.</p>\n\n<p>Jin and I stood hunched in the frigid air, shivering under our thick coats. A blanket of snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky, coating the port and ships in white. I pulled my collar closer to my neck and stuffed my hands into my coat. The chill seemed to penetrate through every stitch of my clothing. I was reminded that Kelesia were of a hearty stock, used to the cold weather of winter, but I felt like I was being frozen from the inside.</p>\n\n<p>We heard the throbbing engine of a skiff long before we saw it. The slender, two-seater craft materialized from the foggy mist, and we watched as the driver and passenger pulled their woolen coats tight against them. Dark goggles concealed their faces, and fur-lined pants swaddled their legs. The skiff hovered gracefully above the snow-covered tarmac before finally settling onto the landing pad. Our breath clouded in front of us as they exited the skiff, their feet shuffling in the snow.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty jumped out of the pilot&#39;s seat while the other man, whom I assumed to be the book&#39;s buyer, also stepped out. His heavy coat and goggles provided protection from the swirling ice. His dark eyes scanned the surroundings as he removed his goggles and stepped toward us. The Tu&#39;s large frame was imposing as he moved closer, determination evident in his expression.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty gestured towards the rear cargo lift of <em>Normandie Place</em> with a gloved hand, and the Tu nodded. We stepped into the cargo bay, our boots clomping on the ramp as we arrived. The space was filled with containers and crates, stacked in precarious towers as if someone had been trying to squeeze every last bit of cargo in.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty took off his gloves and let them hang from his belt. He looked grim in the dim light of the ship, and I could tell something was wrong by his expression.</p>\n\n<p>I swallowed hard and asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The buyer my uncle arranged with has been killed,&quot; Dusty replied gravely. &quot;Someone is trying to eliminate anyone who&#39;s after the Grimoire, putting us all in danger. Malik, who has been our contact on Kelesia, has...&quot; Dusty gestured towards a large blue skinned man who was removing his wide, frosted goggles.</p>\n\n<p>The Tu merchant held up his hand, interrupting Dusty. &quot;Yes, it seems the hands of the Empire are everywhere. We must proceed carefully.&quot; Malik turned to me. &quot;I was next on that list, but was fortunate enough to be in a meeting with associates on the other side of the system. This gives us a window of opportunity. Do you have it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, of course.&quot; I replied. &quot;What–what is it?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I know not. But it is clear that whoever wants the book will stop at nothing to get it. We must find out all we can.&quot; Malik spoke calmly, explaining to us the grim news. &quot;I know of someone who might be able to help.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty’s jaw tensed as he nodded his head. His gaze settled on me, and he spoke in a deep, ominous voice. &quot;We must stay hidden,&quot; he said, emphasizing the word hidden. &quot;You and Malik will go into the city and find this... someone.&quot; His eyes darted across the deck and touched the holster at his hip. To the others, he barked out a warning—stay on board and start getting ready to go. If we needed to leave in a hurry, he wanted us to be prepared.</p>\n\n<p>There were murmurs of assent as Dusty moved away to make preparations.</p>\n\n<p>I was getting closer to the truth, and I hoped that it wasn&#39;t going to cost me my life.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Malik and I stepped out of the skiff into the cold night air. The snow had stopped, but a thin layer still covered the ground. We tucked our hands inside our coat pockets and made our way through the streets of Kelesia, carefully avoiding any attention as we searched for a mysterious shop that was rumored to have information on the Grimoire.</p>\n\n<p>Carit seemed to be quiet, and the snow muffled the sound of our footsteps as we walked. I could smell fresh bread and the scent of wood smoke in the air, and I wondered if all the houses were this warm and inviting at this time of year.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So, you&#39;ve never been to Carit before?&quot; I asked trying to be cheerful.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; He replied simply.</p>\n\n<p>Malik and I trudged along the frozen sidewalk, a hush between us. He was stoic and forbidding, but his eyes were ever alert and his mind seemed to be constantly absorbing and processing information. Despite his reluctance to converse, I knew I could trust him, and felt grateful for his assistance.</p>\n\n<p>All around us people were hustling home to escape the chill, their faces obscured by fur-lined hoods and heavy scarves. Even through the bitter cold and all their winter wear, I could see that the Kelesians had a cheerful look to them.</p>\n\n<p>We continued into the densest and oldest part of the city. Rows of buildings lined the street, practically touching each other. Most of them were old and run down, but there were also some newer ones too. I started to get the feeling that this place was a lot like the rest of the Empire. On the surface, everyone seemed to be living a normal life, but I knew that the city had a darker side, the shadow of which I glimpsed during our journey here.</p>\n\n<p>The buildings seemed to almost form a maze around us. The streets were narrow and dark, and the gloomy night only made it harder for us to navigate our way through the place. I had no idea where we were going until we arrived at a dead end.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is it.&quot; He said. We stood facing a brick wall, lined with pipework, ventilation units, garbage cans, and a few crates. There was no sign of any shop or entrance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This can&#39;t be it, there&#39;s nothing here.&quot; I mumbled.</p>\n\n<p>Malik placed his hand on my shoulder and pointed to the wall. I looked closer. Suddenly, what seemed to be an illusion lifted away and I saw the entrance. A narrow door was tucked away in the corner of the wall, barely visible in the darkness, nearly indistinguishable from the wall around it.</p>\n\n<p>It was a peculiar sight, and I stood there, looking at a door that I swore wasn&#39;t there only moments ago.</p>\n\n<p>I would come to learn of argot doors, and how they were an intrinsic part of the Kelesian culture. They were almost invisible, and were spread throughout the city. During the war of the Seven Colonies, many Kelesians had needed to hide out in the city, sometimes for days, and the argot doors gave them the ability to enter and exit the safe houses without being seen by the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You can only see it, if you&#39;ve seen it.&quot; Malik informed me.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded and followed him through the door, which creaked slowly and opened with a soft groan. We stepped into a narrow, cobblestone-lined alleyway, the walls of which were shrouded in darkness. The cold night air shimmered around us as we crept closer to the end of the alley. A light from the small shop with a snow-dusted roof, grew steadily brighter, inviting us closer. As we drew near, a warmth seemed to radiate from the building, giving us hope that inside we would find something to warm us.</p>\n\n<p>Malik stepped in without hesitation, leading me through the threshold and into a different world. The light inside was inviting, revealing shelves stocked with books, carvings and all manner of trinkets and treasures.</p>\n\n<p>A single candle flickered in a glass lantern, and the light glowed warmly on the one solitary figure that occupied the room. A woman sat on an uncomfortable looking chair, bundled in a heavy blanket, with a pair of glasses on the bridge of her nose. She was reading a large old book.</p>\n\n<p>As we entered, the woman put down her book and stood up. Her eyes were deep and dark, seeming to gaze right into our souls. Her long black hair seemed to move like a river of smoke in the light of the candle.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Malik,&quot; she nodded, her voice full of ancient wisdom beyond years.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Morgana,&quot; Malik replied, with a slight bow of his head.</p>\n\n<p>Malik smiled and introduced me. &quot;This is a friend. Amal.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She smiled then, and stepped closer. She was tall and slender, on her finger she wore a ring set with a large, dark gem that seemed to shimmer and shift in the dim light of the shop. Something about Morgana felt familiar, as if I had known her in another life.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Welcome.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She turned gracefully, her long dress whispering against the floor, and led us to the counter. Her green eyes sparkled as she offered us both a cup of hot tea and gestured for us to sit in a set of small, delicate chairs.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m pleased to finally meet you, Amal.&quot; She said, her voice was ancient, yet soft. As if every word she spoke was a cherished memory, a piece of wisdom, or a secret that she had carried through the centuries.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And you, my lady.&quot; I bowed my head slightly, out of respect.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Tell me, Amal, why have you come?&quot; Lady Morgana said as she crossed the room, her eyes glittering in the flickering candle light.</p>\n\n<p>I took a deep breath, gathering my thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We come to ask for your aid in understanding something... something that has come into my possession.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There was a slight pause as Morgana carefully considered her next words.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And what is it that you have found that now has you so concerned?&quot; she asked.</p>\n\n<p>I slipped my hand into my pocket and drew out the book. I laid it gently on the table, and for a moment, the air seemed to shift, and the room grew still. I could see her eyes widen as she recognized the cover of the Grimoire. She paused for a moment, as if weighing her decision, and then nodded for us to continue.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where did you find this?&quot; she asked me quietly, moving towards the door of the shop. She leaned in close to the window and peered out into the alley; it was vacant and silent. She studied the surroundings for a moment before locking the door with a loud click and drawing the curtains closed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I –&nbsp;I cannot say, my Lady.&quot; I feared to tell her its true, less than noble origins.</p>\n\n<p>She grazed her fingers along the surface of the book and closed her eyes, taking a deep breath.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sutro,&quot; she whispered, then opened her eyes and nodded for me to continue.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I was given the book, by someone that I have worked for. Someone who had acquired it from a thief. It spoke to me, my lady. I know not how or why.&quot; I fumbled the words, trying to explain the inexplicable.</p>\n\n<p>Malik looked on, his eyes wide. &quot;My lady, what do you know of the book?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She raised a slender finger to her lips and shook her head.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is sealed. It has been for many years, for its key has been lost.&quot; She spoke solemnly. &quot;Or so I thought.&quot; Morgana looked at me, &quot;Do you have the key?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I drew <em>Reason to Believe</em> from my holster. I had it tucked away at my back and it slid from it&#39;s sheath with a faint whisper. I held the gun in my hand for a moment, as if looking for a sign. A warmth flowed from the weapon and into my fingers, and I knew I did not have to draw it for her to know the truth.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It sleeps within the weapon, my lady.&quot; I replied.</p>\n\n<p>She crossed the room and took the gun from my hands. She turned it over in her hands, studying it. It shone in the dim light.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is a weapon of power greater than what you know.&quot; Morgana said. &quot;It is connected to the Grimoire, and holds the power to harness its magic.&quot; She paused. &quot;Void magic.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I swallowed hard, suddenly afraid of what I had unleashed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How can that be, my lady?&quot; I asked. &quot;How can this be possible?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She handed the weapon back to me, and sat in silence for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Beyond the Great Expanse, beyond the rimward border of the Imperium lies the Realm of Chaos. It is a plane of raw magic and creation. The home of the gods and the origin of all things. Of those things, I cannot tell you.&quot; Her voice took on a comforting yet foreboding tone.</p>\n\n<p>The Lady stood and moved gracefully to an unlit candle. With a breath, a flame appeared and pale light danced across her face like a many layered veil. Her eyes grew wide as she spoke. &quot;It is said long ago, the first Athylian explorers delved deep into the outer dark. They found a way to harness the power of the Void, and brought it back. It was those who that created the Grimoire, the first spellbooks. The first magic.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She turned to look at me, her eyes narrowed. &quot;And of the first to bear the power of sorcery, one became corrupted by the dark forces of that place. The one&#39;s name was Sutro. He bound the dark forces with the power of the Void and formed the first, and most terrible of weapons.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Reason to Believe</em>&quot; I said. The Lady nodded.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And many others, some of which you may have already encountered. Others, lost to time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So there&#39;s others like this? Other weapons that have been...&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Other weapons imbued with the power of the void, yes.&quot; she said. She returned to her seat and sat silently, her gaze distant. We sat quietly for a moment, until Malik broke the silence.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What of this Grimoire, my lady?&quot; he said, eager to conduct business.</p>\n\n<p>Morgana looked up, her gaze piercing the shadows of the room with a newfound intensity. &quot;Ah, yes. The Grimoire. It could be quite valuable if we could find a buyer for it.&quot; She bit her lip, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she continued. &quot;I happen to know of one. A wealthy merchant named Xandros who deals in such things.&quot; Morgana tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and smiled slyly. She had a reputation for being kind and gentle, but beneath her demure exterior lay a sharp mind and a devious streak born from many years of navigating the shadowy world of illegal trading.</p>\n\n<p>Malik&#39;s eyes widened as he considered the suggestion. &quot;So, we find this Xandros, then?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We both turned to Morgana expectantly, waiting for her endorsement or dismissal of the idea. She nodded slowly in agreement and said, &quot;Yes, you shall.&quot; Continued the Lady, &quot;He is too thorough and cautious a merchant to betray me, and he has need of my skills. If he will agree, you will journey to his estate.&quot; Lady Morgana glanced at both of us, as if assessing our determination. &quot;And I will take a passable cut for myself.&quot; With that said, she smiled, as if pleased with a plan coming together.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; Malik said. &quot;It is decided, then. Hopefully he will be willing to do business with us.&quot; He turned and looked at me. &quot;What do you say, my friend? Are you ready for this?&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The bright, chilly morning light filled the <em>Normandie Place&#39;s</em> windows. Jin cooked a large breakfast that everyone eagerly devoured. The crew was in high spirits as they discussed the powers of the mysterious Grimoire. Sevrea, who had taken a break from working on the ship, added her own opinions to the conversation, but only when it drifted to weapons and space travel.</p>\n\n<p>Just as we finished eating, Malik arrived at the starport to join us on our journey to Xandros&#39;s estate. He offered the traditional Tu greeting of bowing slightly and while clasping his hands, said, &quot;I am here, as promised.&quot; Tu vernacular often overlooked subtlety, but Malik&#39;s words were sincere and he had been true to his word. Years later I would come to understand the true extent of Malik&#39;s loyalty and friendship.</p>\n\n<p>The winter suns shone brightly, reflecting their cold light off the crystalline snowdrifts that blanketed the hills. The chill wind whisked away the broken clouds as they fled over the Kelesian wilds. On we rode, driven by Lady Morgana&#39;s personal coachman, and guided by the road that snaked through evergreen forests and open fields. Malik and Sevrea crouched together in the back of the transport, each wrapped in their own blankets, while I turned to look out of a porthole at the grand manor that appeared in the distance. That was Xandros&#39;s estate.</p>\n\n<p>Malik had roused Sevrea from her doze and pointed it out to her as well. &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; he declared, &quot;Duskfall Manor. Xandros&#39;s personal castle.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea&#39;s gaze was fixated upon the looming structure. &quot;It looks like a fortress,&quot; she said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is,&quot; Malik replied.</p>\n\n<p>We descended the hill, the transport kicking up a dust of powder on the freshly fallen snow, before ultimately coming to a stop in front of Duskfall Manor&#39;s imposing gates. The driver opened the doors of the transport, and we stepped out. The cold air was brimming with the scent of pine and frost, and the surrounding forest was filled with a chorus of birdsong.</p>\n\n<p>My companions and I made our way to the gates, where a guard met us. He had eyes like chips of emerald set in a bearded face and a stiff bearing. His facial hair was styled in the customary Kelesian manner, and he wore the uniform of Duskfall Manor — a black and gold tabard, embroidered with the mark of a great wolf.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We are here on behalf of Lady Morgana,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; His voice rumbled. We had been expected. &quot;I am the Captain of the Guard, Captain Bülent. Please follow me, and I shall show you to Lord Xandros&#39;s study.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The guard led us through the gates and into a courtyard surrounded by high stone walls. The snow crunched beneath our feet as we followed him into a grand manor house. We eventually came to a a warmly lit hallway. We passed several doors, each of them carefully guarded. We were eventually led to a wooden door at the end of the corridor, and Bülent motioned for us to wait. He knocked on the door, spoke a few words in what I assumed was Kelesian, and then opened the door for us.</p>\n\n<p>Xandros&#39;s study was a large room filled with bookshelves and maps. A tall desk sat at the center of the room, and behind it, a large window overlooked the courtyard. A fire crackled in the hearth, and in front of it, two chairs were arranged. In one of them, Lord Xandros sat, reading a letter.</p>\n\n<p>He looked up as we entered, and nodded to us in recognition. &quot;Ah, the group from Lady Morgana,&quot; he said in a deep voice. &quot;I trust your journey was pleasant?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We all nodded in agreement, and Lord Xandros beckoned us to take our seats. His thick dark hair was threaded through with strands of silver, and his kind face bore a warm smile. He exuded a peacefulness that put us all at ease.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Xandros laid his letter down and looked up at us with a serious expression. &quot;Now. I understand you have something of great interest to offer me,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; I said. &quot;We have a book in our possession that we believe you may be interested in purchasing.&quot; I reached into my pocket and pulled out the <em>Grimoire of Sutro Dek-ratu</em>, placing it on a small table in front of me and sliding it forward.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Xandros&#39;s eyes widened in surprise as I placed the book on the desk. &quot;My, my,&quot; he rumbled. &quot;This is a most interesting find. It is a testament to your skills that you have managed to acquire such a treasure.&quot; He picked up the book, stroking his chin in thought.</p>\n\n<p>I cleared my throat. &quot;If I may, my lord. We were led to believe that you may be interested in purchasing this book. And of course, keeping it safe from...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;...From those who would use its contents to harm,&quot; Lord Xandros finished my sentence. He nodded in agreement. &quot;Yes, indeed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As he placed the book on the table, he stood from his chair and began to walk back and forth across the room. Uncertainty filled his eyes, and he sighed as he looked towards the window. &quot;You may not know this, but I am a member of an ancient group called the Order of the Celestial Beacon, dedicated to protecting the ancient knowledge and technologies of our distant ancestors. Lady Morgana sought me out because of my involvement in this order. As she&#39;s done in the past.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We all nodded, our attention focused on Lord Xandros. He continued his pacing.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For many years now, we have been aware of the existence of this <em>Grimoire of Sutro Dek-ratu</em>. We knew it was out there, waiting to be discovered. But we never thought it would be found so soon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is our belief that this book contains–&quot; Xandros stopped mid-sentence, his mouth agape. He stared at me for a moment, as if he had seen a ghost.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Contains?&quot; Sevrea asked, confused.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Xandros held up his hand to quiet her and peered through the window to his courtyard, his eyes scanning the horizon. &quot;It seems we are about to have company,&quot; he said with a grim expression. In the sky above the wide open field beyond the manor house, a cluster of dark shapes descended from the sky. Like a flock of vultures, they circled lower and lower until they were close enough for us to see that they were, in fact, ships.</p>\n\n<p>The group of us leaped to our feet, our hands instinctively going to our weapons, and we ran to the window. The three small transports touched down, their engines kicking up a cloud of snow. They were sleek, black vessels with sharp angles and a deadly look about them. It struck me that these craft did not carry the livery of the Imperial Navy, but rather bore no markings at all.</p>\n\n<p>The ships settled into the snow with a thud, and their engines powered down with a harsh whine. A moment later, the ramp of the lead vessel lowered, and a squad of imperial dark cloaked figures marched down it, their boots crunching in the snow, scarlet capes billowing in the frigid wind like bloodstained wings.</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom of the ramp, the squad&#39;s leader stopped, turned to face the manor house, and then shouted something in old Athylian. They fanned out into the courtyard, weapons at the ready.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who are they?&quot; I whispered.</p>\n\n<p>Bülent burst into the room, his hand on his holstered sidearm. Behind him were two more of his men, each with their long rifles at the ready. &quot;My lord,&quot; He said breathing heavily, &quot;Reapers. We must leave immediately.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The captain of the guard nodded and turned towards the door. &quot;This way,&quot; he said, motioning for us to follow him. He led us out into the hallway and towards the back of the house. We ran down a narrow corridor and then down a flight of stairs. Gunfire erupted, and the sound of shattering glass echoed through the manor house. We burst through a door and into the kitchen. Cooks and servants scrambled to get out of our way as we ran through, and Bülent shouted orders in Kelesian.</p>\n\n<p>It was at that moment a stack of plates exploded behind us, showering us with ceramic shrapnel. I turned to see a dark figure in the doorway, clad in black with a red cape tied around its neck. A black helmet obscured its features, and it held a strange looking rifle in its hands. The figure stepped into the room, its boots crushing the broken plates and spilled food beneath them. It raised its rifle and pointed it in our direction.</p>\n\n<p>Before I could draw, Sevrea reacted. Two shots rang out in quick succession, and the figure fell to the floor in a heap. Sevrea turned to me, her eyes wide with fear. &quot;We have to go!&quot; she said. Screams rang out behind us as we fled the kitchen and down a flight of stairs into the main hall.</p>\n\n<p>It was too late. The hall was swarming with dark figures, their weapons at the ready. We skidded to a halt, and I instinctively reached for my sidearm.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; Sevrea whispered, placing a hand on my arm. &quot;There&#39;s too many of them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; I said, trembling with fear. There was a cold, almost evil look about these men. I had never seen anything like it.</p>\n\n<p>Bülent stepped forward, his rifle at the ready. He shouted something in Kelesian, then in an instant he was engulfed by the black figures. There was a moment of stillness, then there was a terrible screech, like that of a wounded animal, and Bülent fell to the floor.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Captain!&quot; one of the other men called out.</p>\n\n<p>The leader of the squad raised his hand and the room fell still and silent, save for the sound of Bülent&#39;s labored breathing. His men stepped away from us.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Valtor.&quot; Bülent coughed, then spat blood onto the floor. He was clutching his chest with one hand and struggling to breathe.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My reputation precedes me, I see,&quot; said the leader of the squad, stepping closer.</p>\n\n<p>Valtor removed his helmet and tossed it to the floor. He stared at us with a cold, calculating expression and then brushed his dirty black hair out of his eyes. A scar crossed his forehead, and his eyes were as black as coal. &quot;Where&#39;s the book?&quot; he said, his voice a harsh whisper.</p>\n\n<p>No one answered. We were all too afraid.</p>\n\n<p>Valtor held up his hands. &quot;Don&#39;t make me ask again,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>I was still clutching the book in my hands, but I had no intention of telling Valtor that.</p>\n\n<p>He stepped forward and grabbed Xandros by the collar. &quot;Don&#39;t play games with me,&quot; he hissed. &quot;I know you have it. Where is it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; Xandros said, struggling to get loose.</p>\n\n<p>The man released his grip on Xandros and then turned to Sevrea. &quot;Where&#39;s the book?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said, trembling.</p>\n\n<p>He grabbed her by the arm and pulled her close. &quot;Don&#39;t lie to me,&quot; he hissed. He pointed his sidearm at her head. &quot;Where&#39;s the book?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; I yelled. I stepped forward and pushed him away from her. &quot;Leave her alone!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He turned to me, his eyes narrowed in anger. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m the one who has the book,&quot; I said. &quot;Now let her go.&quot; Holding the Grimoire in my hand, it&#39;s cold, hardcover pressing into my palm, I stepped forward.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing!&quot; Xandros yelled, but Valtor&#39;s icy glare silenced him.</p>\n\n<p>Valtor reached out toward me. &quot;Give me the book, girl.&quot; Still holding Sevrea, he reached for me with his other hand.</p>\n\n<p>I glanced down at the book in my hands and hesitated.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal. Please,&quot; Xandros begged. &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t worth their lives. I stepped closer to Valtor and held out the Grimoire.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I watched in horror as Valtor threw the Grimoire to the ground, a triumphant grin spreading across his face. He leaned down, his black eyes glinting with malice, and whispered, &quot;You&#39;ve just made a glorious mistake.&quot; My heart pounded in my chest as he motioned to his men, his voice cold and calculated. &quot;Kill them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>They raised their weapons, their cold, emotionless eyes trained on me and my companions. I braced myself for the impending attack, my heart racing with fear.</p>\n\n<p>The first shot rang out and I closed my eyes waiting for the impact. But it never came. When I opened my eyes, I saw that the men had dropped to the floor, their bodies lifeless. It was as if they had been cut down by an unseen force, their bodies crumpling to the floor.</p>\n\n<p>I looked down at my hands in shock, realizing that I was holding my sidearm, <em>Reason to Believe</em>. Smoke drifted from the barrel, and I had no recollection of even pulling the trigger. The weapon had roared to life in my hands, seemingly controlled by its own ancient and evil will. It had commanded me to fire, and I had been powerless to resist. I had taken down all six men with six precise shots, each one finding its mark within a single heartbeat.</p>\n\n<p>I stood there, breathless, as the echoes of the gunshots faded away. The room was still, save for the sound of Bülent&#39;s labored breathing and the ringing of my ears. With the weapon still trained on Valtor, I was left wondering why it hadn&#39;t fired again. Had it used up all of its power in that one devastating burst? Or was there some other reason, some unknown force that had stayed its hand?</p>\n\n<p>I looked at Valtor, who was staring at me in shock, his eyes wide and his mouth open. He was holding the Grimoire, but it seemed to have lost its importance in the face of what had just happened.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What… what happened?&quot; Sevrea whispered.</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Valtor had run towards a narrow side hall, slipping away while my attention was on Sevrea.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Stop him!&quot; I shouted.</p>\n\n<p>Sevrea raised her pistol and took a shot, but he was already gone. I started to run after him, but Malik grabbed my arm.</p>\n\n<p>Footsteps and shouting echoed from the hallway. I was sure our pursuers were coming back, and with them the reinforcements they had undoubtedly called in.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We have to go,&quot; the Tu said. &quot;They&#39;ll be coming for us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Xandros knelt next to Bülent, helping him to his feet. The wounded man grabbed his arm, wincing in pain.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My Lord. The book.&quot; I started, unsure of what to say.</p>\n\n<p>Xandros shook his head. &quot;There&#39;s nothing we can do about that right now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What about Valtor?&quot; Sevrea said, taking hold of my arm. &quot;We have to do something.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Go. I&#39;ll slow them down.&quot; He then drew his sidearm and moved to stand in front of Bülent, with his back to the narrow hall.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on!&quot; Malik said, pulling me in the opposite direction. &quot;We have to get out of here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I stumbled towards Malik and Sevrea, already regretting my decision to leave Xandros behind. We rounded a corner and ran through a few narrow hallways. I looked back in the direction we had come, but there was no sign of our pursuers. </p>\n\n<p>We finally emerged into a vast atrium, the bright mid-day sun pouring through the skylights above and casting a dazzling light over the room. I could see the double wooden doors at the far end, beckoning us to safety. We sprinted towards them, but just as we were about to reach them, they burst open and more of our enemies rushed into the room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t shoot!&quot; a voice shouted.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Dusty?!&quot; I exclaimed, lowering my guard.</p>\n\n<p>It was him. He was a bit disheveled, but otherwise unharmed, but it was definitely him. And he was not alone. Behind him Jin, and <em>Woeful Mordred</em> followed. Olen must of stayed with the ship.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What happened?&quot; Jin asked.</p>\n\n<p>Still in shock, I managed to answer him. &quot;He&#39;s gone.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And they stole the book,&quot; Malik said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This way,&quot; Dusty said, taking charge. He led us towards the same doors he and Jin had just come through, and I followed, grateful for the guidance. We did not see Valtor or the Reapers, but we could hear them engaging with the Duskfall Manor guard in the distance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How? How did you know we...&quot; I started.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lady Morgana.&quot; Dusty said. &quot;Someone here must have sent word.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She warned you?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty nodded. &quot;And sent us to help.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I fell silent for a moment. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We stumbled out of the door and into the gray winter day, the sky heavy with clouds that threatened to release a flurry of snow at any moment. The snow that covered the ground was a dirty brown, trodden down by countless feet. Duskfall Manor shrank behind us.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where&#39;s the ship?&quot; Servea asked, dismayed.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty pointed to the north, past the gardens and to the rear of the manor where the hill was too steep for the gardens to be maintained. The stern of the <em>Normandie Place</em> was visible, poking out from a copse of trees. The ship was not far away.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; I said, pushing myself forward.</p>\n\n<p>As we reached the gardens, we paused for a moment to catch our breath and try to get our bearings. The trees were bare, their branches reaching out like gnarled fingers. The bushes were mere skeletons, the remnants of their leaves a soggy mess on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Dusty, who had taken charge of the group, led us off towards the ship. We followed him, our feet slipping and sliding on the icy ground as we ran through the dreary gardens. The sound of the Reapers&#39; firefight grew fainter and fainter until it was nothing more than a distant memory. Finally, panting and out of breath, we came to <em>Normandie Place</em>, Olen waiting for us at the ramp.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You got it?&quot; she asked.</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\n\n<p>A burst of thruster fire came from the direction of the manor, and we all turned to see a ship launching from the back. I narrowed my eyes followed shortly by the booming sounds of weapons fire. The rumble of war become audible again. Olen cursed quietly and raised her rifle, peering through its powerful optics.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Assault shuttle,&quot; she said. &quot;Unmarked. And in a hurry.&quot; Her rifle followed the ship as it lifted off, climbing higher into the atmosphere as it cleared the roof of the manor.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Valtor.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>The assault shuttle tilted slightly as it gained altitude, turning away. I could see another ship, a smaller one, following closely behind it. I watched as the two ships disappeared into the distance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He&#39;s getting away.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;For now,&quot; Dusty said. He turned and started towards the ship. &quot;Come on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We all followed him up the ramp, the doors hissing shut behind us. I looked back at the manor one last time, wondering if I would ever see it again.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Within the hour, we&#39;d made it back to the spaceport in Carit. We were set to say our goodbyes to Malik, when Lady Morgana arrived with a small group of her own. Their hooded cloaks billowed in the wind as they marched towards us over the freshly fallen snow.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal. You&#39;re alright,&quot; she said, coming to a stop in front of me. Her words were respectful, but there was an edge to her voice.</p>\n\n<p>I inclined my head. &quot;Yes, my lady.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you well. And your friends.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I looked over at Dusty and Jin who both nodded in response. &quot;Thank you for your help, my lady,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; She looked me in the eye. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about the Grimore.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; I said. After all, her portion of the proceeds were also stolen when Valtor took the Grimore.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal. We&#39;ll find him,&quot; Dusty said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I know you will,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re sure you don&#39;t want to come with us?&quot; he asked.</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. &quot;No. I need to understand what&#39;s going on. This is bigger than just me and the Grimore.&quot; I sighed. &quot;Besides, Malik knows an old frigate that&#39;s only a few cycles ride from here. She&#39;s not fancy, but she&#39;ll get us to Port Bethany.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty frowned, but didn&#39;t plead with me to come with him. I&#39;d made up my mind.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Alright,&quot; he said. He turned to Malik. &quot;Thanks for the help.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty nodded and extended his hand. I shook it, and he pulled me into a hug. &quot;Take care of yourself,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You too.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He released me and turned to Jin and Servea. &quot;Ready?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>They both nodded, and the three of them boarded <em>Normandie Place</em>. The ramp retracted, and the ship&#39;s engines fired up. I watched as it lifted off the ground and disappeared into the sky.</p>\n\n<p>I turned to Lady Morgana. &quot;What now?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come with me,&quot; she said, &quot;It&#39;s time we had a talk.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>9</h1>\n\n<p>My eyes flew open as a gentle knocking rapped against my door. I sat up in bed, my mind clouded with sleep. I pushed the sheets off me and looked towards the door. Morning light peeked through the curtains, two of the three Kelesian suns casting long shadows across the floor like a crisscrossed tapestry.</p>\n\n<p>The knocking came again. &quot;Just a minute,&quot; I called out, my voice gruff with sleep.</p>\n\n<p>I stepped out of the bed onto the creaking wooden floor and grabbed a robe, wrapping it around my bare body. The only hotel in Carit was dirty and old, and the rooms were equipped with nothing more than a bed and a few drawers. Not that I was complaining. After everything that happened, I was more than happy to get some sleep.</p>\n\n<p>I marched towards the door, tying the robe as I went. There was another knock. I sighed and pulled it open.</p>\n\n<p>Malik stood outside, his tall frame taking up most of the doorway. He held a brown paper package in one hand and was smiling when I opened the door. Stepping into the room the considerate Tu gently closed the door, not wanting to wake the other guests that were sleeping.</p>\n\n<p>&quot; have brought you breakfast,&quot; he said. Tu&#39;s were known for their hospitality, always eager to please, and Malik was no exception. He held out the package to me, and I took it, feeling grateful for his kindness.</p>\n\n<p>He raised the package up to me, and I took it. His blue body peered at me expectantly, waiting to see what I thought of the food.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do that,&quot; I said. Something about Malik made me feel comfortable, maybe it was his genuine kindness or the way he always seemed to know what I needed even before I did.</p>\n\n<p>He shrugged. &quot;One must always eat.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It was then that I realized how hungry I was. The smell of the bread drew me in, and my mouth watered as I undid the string that bound the package together and unwrapped the worn paper. Inside was warm bread, jam, and a round cheese that I&#39;d never seen before. The small wedge had been wrapped in muslin and tied with a bit of twine. Smiling, I took a bite of the foreign food. A scent rose from it, soft and sweet, like strawberries and cream. Kelesian breakfast, I thought to myself.</p>\n\n<p>I took a bite of my food and watched Malik staring out the window. Outside, a girl wearing a purple scarf and cloak was selling Arann berries on the street below to stay warm. The fruit was only available in the winter season, round and bright colored with white fur over it. Her cheeks were rosy red from the biting cold wind, but her face didn&#39;t show any sign of discomfort.</p>\n\n<p>I took another bite of food and set the bread down. &quot;So, what&#39;s our plan?&quot; I asked, finding some privacy to get dressed, I slipped into the small washroom.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The town of Landon,&quot; He started as I closed the door. &quot;It&#39;s a few cycles&#39; journey north. I think you&#39;ll like it. Very old Kelesian architecture.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I glanced in the mirror above the sink, which was streaked with fingerprints and dust. My complexion was sallow, and my eyes seemed to have sunk deeper into their sockets since I had last looked in a mirror. I stuck my hands in the sink basin of icy water and ran it over my face, then ran my fingers through my disheveled hair. A brush or comb would help tame it, but I&#39;d have to look elsewhere for one. Taking off my robe, I tugged on my pants. Layering on a few more shirts and a jacket to combat the cold Kelesian weather, the reflection in the mirror was getting closer to the one I was used to.</p>\n\n<p>I poked my head out of the washroom. &quot;We should leave within the cycle,&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>Malik nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve already booked us passage.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When I left the washroom, Malik was standing by the window, watching the little girl sell her fruit. I walked up next to him, admiring the simple sight. Beyond us, the city was cold and dreary , but the girl&#39;s bright purple scarf brought a small bit of warmth to my heart.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I like that color,&quot; I said, pointing to the girl&#39;s scarf.</p>\n\n<p>He nodded, his mind elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What did she tell you?&quot; He asked, his eyes still focused on the street below. &quot;Lady Morgana.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I sighed. A long, deep sigh.</p>\n\n<p>Malik was silent for a moment. A mounted Kelesian police officer rode past, tooting on his whistle. The sound was almost melodic, like a bird&#39;s song. Malik turned to look at me. &quot;You know what you are, then?&quot; He asked. His eyes were gentle and kind.</p>\n\n<p>I nodded. &quot;I know now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I know now that I would never be safe. That I would always be the one in their way. I knew that now I was a danger to everyone I loved and everyone around me. <em>Reason to Believe</em> was the key to unlocking so many things I&#39;d never imagined. I had become it&#39;s keeper and protector, and that meant my life would never be normal again.</p>\n\n<p>What that meant for Dusty and the rest of the crew, I didn&#39;t know. We had parted ways with the <em>Normandie Place</em> at the spaceport in Carit. There was no going back after that. I hated to leave them behind. Dusty had given me a choice. I could stay, or I could find my own way.</p>\n\n<p>I had chosen the latter.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I did not come here to talk about that,&quot; he said. &quot;I came to make sure you were alright.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I took another breath and released it slowly. &quot;I think I&#39;m alright,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m alive, at least.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Eat something,&quot; Malik urged. &quot;We have a long way to go.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Landon, then. I nodded, taking another bite of the bread and cheese. The taste was comforting, a simple pleasure in the midst of so much uncertainty. The conversation with Lady Morgana still weighed heavily on my mind, but I knew that I couldn&#39;t dwell on it.</p>\n\n<p>As we finished our breakfast, Malik shared stories of Landon, its beautiful architecture, and the ship he knew was there. It was named <em>Opportune</em>, a sturdy old frigate that would take us to Port Bethany and beyond. I listened to his stories, my mind wandering to the adventures that lay ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Like the girl outside, I knew I had to stay strong against the biting winds of change. There was no turning back now, no seeking the normalcy of a life left behind. <em>Reason to Believe</em>, the weapon of such power sat on the side table. It appeared almost innocent, its metallic surface glinting in the sunlight that filtered through the dusty window panes.</p>\n\n<p>I took it up, holstering it at my side , feeling the weight of the responsibility it carried. As I did, I glanced one last time at the girl outside, her purple scarf flapping in the wind, an emblem of determination and hope. I looked at Malik, his eyes filled with the same hope, and I knew that together, we would face whatever challenges lay ahead of us.</p>\n\n<p>With a newfound resolve, I slung my bag over my shoulder, gripping the strap tightly. Malik did the same, his blue body standing tall and proud beside me. We shared a nod, a silent agreement that we were ready to embark on this journey together.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The once daily train to Landon left Carit on time. Malik had indeed made all the arrangements, and we were able to secure a small private cabin for the journey. The train was old but well-maintained, and the rhythmic clacking of the wheels on the tracks was almost soothing. The interior of the cabin was modest, with two cushioned benches facing each other and a small table between them. A single window looked out over the passing landscape, the snow-covered fields giving way to thick, snow-laden forests as we traveled further north.</p>\n\n<p>Malik sat across from me, his eyes closed in meditation. The Tu people had a deep connection to the spiritual world, and Malik was no exception. He claimed that his meditations allowed him to attune himself to the ebb and flow of the universe, to find a sense of peace and balance in the midst of chaos. I envied him that ability, especially now. As the train sped along, I found myself watching him, fascinated by the stillness of his body and the serenity that seemed to radiate from him. I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it would be like to be able to shut out the world like that, to simply let go of all my fears and doubts and find solace in the infinite tapestry of existence.</p>\n\n<p>His chest rose and fell like a gentle wave, his breathing slow and deep. I decided to leave him to his meditation and ventured out of our cabin to explore the rest of the train. The narrow corridor was bustling with activity. There were people of all sorts walking up and down, chatting animatedly, or simply staring out of the windows as the world flew by.</p>\n\n<p>A group of Ra&#39;ashi merchants, clad in their traditional bright silks and furs, haggled over prices and bartered with each other. Their voices filled the air, a cacophony of laughter and the tinkling of coins. The Ra&#39;ashi were known for their shrewdness in business, and it was clear that they took every opportunity to strike a deal, even on a moving train. Dusty and I encountered these folk once, and despite their intimidating appearance, they were quite amicable and open to negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>Making my way further down the corridor, I encountered a family of Kalshi nomads, their faces etched with swirling tattoos that told the stories of their ancestors. They sat on the floor, their legs crossed, as they shared a simple meal of flatbread and dried fruits. The Kalshi were wanderers, always in search of new experiences and lands to explore, and while many viewed them with suspicion or scorn, I couldn&#39;t help but admire their resilience and tight-knit sense of community.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I came across a small tea cart, tucked away in a quiet corner of the train. It was a quaint affair, with a meticulously polished brass frame and delicate cups and saucers. The scent of freshly brewed tea and spices filled the air, and I found myself drawn towards it.</p>\n\n<p>An elderly woman with a kind and gentle face, her silver hair tucked neatly beneath a lace cap, stood behind the cart, her hands deftly pouring steaming tea into an ornate cup. She looked up as I approached and her eyes, a deep, warm brown, seemed to twinkle in the low light.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah, you look like someone in need of a good cup of tea,&quot; she said, her voice soft and melodicas the sound of a gently flowing stream. &quot;Please, have a seat and let me serve you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I gratefully sank down onto one of the plush velvet stools that lined the small counter, feeling the weight of the day begin to lift from my shoulders. The woman set the warm cup in front of me, the fragrant steam caressing my face as I leaned in to take a sip. The tea was rich and full-bodied, like molten gold on my tongue, and I could taste layers of exotic spices.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; I murmured, the warmth of the tea soothing me from the inside out.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this was my meditation. My way offinding solace and peace amidst the chaos of the journey. As I let the aromatic liquid wash away the fatigue and stress of the last few days, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of gratitude towards the woman and her magical tea cart.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re most welcome, dear,&quot; she replied, her eyes crinkling with a knowing smile. &quot;Sometimes, all we need is a moment of respite, a little oasis in the storm of life.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She moved on to serve other passengers who had discovered the sanctuary of her tea cart, but her words stayed with me, echoing in my mind as I sipped my tea. The clatter and clamor of the train seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the steady rhythm of the rocking train.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The journey to Landon took the better part of a day, and as the sun began to dip towards the horizon, I could see the distant outlines of the town&#39;s buildings. Malik stirred from his meditation, opening his eyes and stretching his long limbs. He caught me watching him and gave me a small smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be there soon,&quot; he said, his voice soft and gentle.</p>\n\n<p>As the train pulled into Landon&#39;s small station, I got my first glimpse of the town. It was a quiet, peaceful place, nestled in a valley surrounded by tall, snow-capped mountains. The buildings were old, in the traditional Kelesian style, with steep, sloping roofs and intricate wooden carvings adorning the eaves. The streets were narrow and cobbled, lined with shops and houses that seemed to huddle together against the cold.</p>\n\n<p>We disembarked from the train and made our way through the quiet streets, the air crisp and cold, our breath visible in small white puffs. The townsfolk we passed greeted us with friendly smiles and nods, their faces ruddy from the cold. It was a far cry from the chaos and danger we had left behind in Duskfall Manor, and I found myself feeling a sense of relief as we walked.</p>\n\n<p>Malik led me to the outskirts of the town, to a shipyard nestled near the icy waters of the harbor, where the starship <em>Opportune</em> was waiting for us. It was an old, weathered ship, its once-sleek hull marred by countless scratches and dents, but it had a certain charm to it. It had the look of a ship that had seen many adventures and had come through them all, battered but unbroken.</p>\n\n<p>We approached the ship, and Malik introduced me to the owner, a grizzled old Kelesian He shook my hand with a firm grip, his eyes appraising me as he did so. &quot;Cain.&quot; He said, his voice low and gravelly. The man was a seasoned spacefarer, with scars and wrinkles that spoke to a life of adventure and hardship. I could sense his mistrust of me, but I knew that Malik had vouched for me, and that was enough.</p>\n\n<p>The three of us stepped into a small shack near the yard, where Cain had set up his makeshift office. It was warmer, yes, the air inside was thick with the scent of tobacco and rum. A small wood stove sat in one corner, its smokestack blackened with soot. Cain gestured for us to take a seat at a small table, and we obliged. Cain sat across from us, his intense gaze still fixed on me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A Tu and a human, looking for passage to the frontier?&quot; he said, his tone skeptical. Cain leaned back in his chair, his fingers drumming against the surface of the table. &quot;It&#39;s not exactly a common sight.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head. &quot;We&#39;re not seeking passage, sir. We&#39;re here to buy the <em>Opportune</em>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cain raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised by my declaration. His eyes flicked to Malik, who simply nodded in confirmation. A slow grin spread across the old Kelesian&#39;s face, revealing a row of yellowing teeth.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Buy her, eh?&quot; he said, leaning back in his chair. &quot;Well, I suppose she is for sale, but she won&#39;t come cheap. They don’t make these Gypsies anymore, not like they used to.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We began the process of making a deal. Cain was a shrewd negotiator, and it was clear that he knew the value of his ship, even if it was past its prime. Lady Morgana had provided us with a small cache of funds, but it wasn&#39;t enough to cover the full cost of <em>Opportune</em>. Malik, however, had a solution.</p>\n\n<p>He brought his hands up to the collar of his robe, unclasped the brooch, and gently opened the folds to reveal a small fraying bag, where three ancient Tu artifacts lay nestled. The lantern-shaped carvings glimmered in the light, their surfaces adorned with intricate etchings and inlaid with gold and silver filigree. Cain picked one up tenderly, admiring its craftsmanship and realizing instantly that he was holding something of great value.</p>\n\n<p>The Lanterns come in various shapes and sizes, each one unique and exquisite. Some were spherical, others were elongated or asymmetrical, yet all possessed an ethereal, otherworldly beauty that was impossible to replicate. The etchings on their surfaces depicted scenes of Tu history and culture, with each lantern telling a different story.</p>\n\n<p>These artifacts were known as Lanterns of the Lost, a name that held a melancholy air within the Tu community. Long ago, the Lanterns had been created by the greatest artisans of the Tu people. They were said to hold the collective memory of the lives and spirits of the lost generations, those who had been scattered across the galaxy during the enslavement of their race. Each lantern was a testament to the resilience and the indomitable spirit of the Tu people, who, despite the pain and suffering they had endured, continued to survive and cling to their heritage.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lanterns of the Lost,&quot; Malik explained, his voice steady. &quot;Very rare, very valuable. A piece of my people&#39;s history. We can offer you these, in addition to the funds we have,&quot; Malik said, his voice steady. &quot;I believe they are more than enough to cover the remainder of the cost.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cain hesitated for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Aye, I believe that they are. You have a deal.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We shook on it, and I breathed a sigh of relief. The deal was made, and <em>Opportune</em> was ours.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Are you sure about this, Malik?&quot; I asked him as we stepped back outside into the icy air, our breaths clouding around us. &quot;Are you okay with letting them go?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Malik looked at me, his bright eyes warm and filled with understanding. &quot;Amal, I am a Tu. My people&#39;s history is within me, and these artifacts are but a small representation of our rich past. If they can help us secure a future, ensure the safety of Lady Morgana and perhaps even bring about change for our worlds, then it is a worthy trade.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nodded, touched by his words and the wisdom behind them. </p>\n\n<p>I looked up at the old ship, its hull scarred from countless battles and adventures, and I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of excitement. This was the beginning of a new journey, a chance to unravel the mysteries that surrounded me and <em>Reason to Believe</em>. And, maybe along the way, find some semblance of safety.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; I said, my voice filled with determination. &quot;Let&#39;s see what this old girl can do.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>10</h1>\n\n<p>Two long, hard years have passed since I watched Dusty&#39;s ship rocket off into the bright Kelesian sky. I&#39;ve made a lot of changes since then; I&#39;m using all of my acquired talents – smuggler, gunslinger, pilot – picking up odd jobs wherever I can to keep <em>Opportune</em> flying. I&#39;m living on the edge, constantly looking over my shoulder, and never staying in one place for too long. But it&#39;s worth it, because I&#39;m free.</p>\n\n<p>The latest deal brings me here. To this forsaken, sun-scorched planet, where the only signs of life are the occasional cacti plants and the hardy reptiles that scurry beneath the desert rocks. It&#39;s a place where the sun beats down mercilessly, and the nights are as dark and frigid as the vacuum of space itself. A place where even the wind seems to want to strip the life from you, leaving nothing but bone and dust.</p>\n\n<p>But as desolate and unforgiving as Bowenn II is, it&#39;s the perfect place for an off-the-books deal to go down. . A place where prying eyes and Imperial law enforcement would never think to look.</p>\n\n<p>The wind howls past an abandoned antenna complex, a once-essential communications hub now consumed by the shifting sands. Its pillars loom like broken teeth, and the huge dish at its center is scarred by the relentless heat. It&#39;s a relic of a bygone age, marked with the sturdy script of the Athylia colony.</p>\n\n<p>My ship, <em>Opportune</em>, offers the only shade for miles around. Sweat trickles down my face as I scan the desolate landscape, waiting for my contact. The shipment is officially designated as PARTS, MECHANICAL by Athylian customs, but I know the truth. And if anyone asks, I&#39;ll just flash them a charming smile and play dumb. It&#39;s worked before. No one would believe me, even if they did ask. Delivering parts to the middle of nowhere on a deserted planet? But they never ask. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, in the blistering heat, waiting.</p>\n\n<p>I toss my empty water canister into <em>Opportune&#39;s</em> open cargo hold. It bangs on the deck before laying to rest near the liftgate controls. I step into the shade offered by the hold and turn once more to the horizon, hopeful for a sign in the distance. I hold my gaze for a time, looking for movement amid the bleak landscape before returning to the underside of the fuselage.</p>\n\n<p>Frustrated, I flop onto the warm sand and sit upright, my knees bent, arms hugging them, hands clasped. The shade offers only the smallest taste of relief. I adjust my scarf again, letting the air cool my sweating neck before retying it, gazing at the desolation before me.</p>\n\n<p>Although an arid desert, the Bay of Dawn provides a mild, northern climate compared to the rest of this hellish planet. Harsh terrain and far worse conditions lie near the equator. There, a system of canyons runs east to west for 3,000 km, a large scar in the crust of this equally massive red rock.</p>\n\n<p>A glint of light flashes, catching my eye. I perk up and tighten my vision. Heat glare distorts the hazy golden horizon, but I sense something. Another white glint sparkles in the haze where the land meets the distant mountains. I stand and brush myself off.</p>\n\n<p>The mountains play backdrop to a dust trail kicking into the sky. I rush to the cargo bay door and rummage through my outer garments. They&#39;ve been piling up over the last hour due to the heat. At the bottom of the pile, I find a high-power ocular sight. An excellent and sturdy tool handcrafted long before the war and entrusted to the imperial vanguard scouts, of which I was decidedly not a member.</p>\n\n<p>A sturdy hinged metal cover protects the rectangular front lens of the scout sight. The mechanism is spring-loaded in both the closed and open positions, allowing for the quick and smooth operation of the front lens cover. With a small amount of force, I lift the lid, and the machine takes over, opening the cover to a perpendicular position to the lens.</p>\n\n<p>With the lens open, I hear the windings inside emit a high-pitched whine as they charge. I adjust the focus on the object, causing the dust trail — a mid-size surface craft speeds above the sand. Through the lens, it appears obscured by atmospheric reflections and distortions. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who might this be?&quot; I whisper to myself, trying to discern any details from the mirage-like image.</p>\n\n<p>I switch on the gyroscopic stabilizer on the sight to improve the resolution and clarity. Torque twists my arms as the tool&#39;s internal gyroscope fights to keep the optics stable. The craft draws closer. Too advanced to be raiders or scavengers, it&#39;s an old colonial surface transport, and it&#39;s heavily modified. New, thick, angled armor plating juts from the bow, and it&#39;s carrying larger than normal engine nacelles.</p>\n\n<p>As it crests the next ridge, unseen details emerge. The craft is flying a banner I&#39;ve never seen before, a blue and white lozenge pattern on one side, with a red creature and a cluster of three stars on the other. It&#39;s whipping against its mast as the craft speeds through the desolate landscape. It makes a full turn, and the flag disappears into a sliver as it is now facing me. Watching, they press forward and fall out of the tight focus my optics hold.</p>\n\n<p>I touch the small wheel on the side of the device. A quick adjustment and the image regains clarity. The transport is moving fast, darting across the endless field of grit and sand. Closer now, I spot two smaller tandem-seat skiffs leading the carrier. I listen for their engines and watch through the rectangular viewport of my sight. The skiffs disappear below the horizon into a shallow dune followed by the transport. Their dust trails are thick, chasing them like the shadow of time. Plumes of smoke churn and dissolve into the red-orange sky.</p>\n\n<p>The skiff riders crest the nearest dune and approach at high speed. The dust masked riders slow to examine me through their dark goggles. Without stopping, they race off to the nearby antenna complex. The dusty transport follows in their wake, but slows and comes to a complete stop near my ship. Its loud engines are winding down as it settles onto the sand like a lumbering animal looking for a place to roost. The transport&#39;s engines shift to a lower pitch as they spool down to idle. The craft drops to the sand, engines still howling.</p>\n\n<p>The two heavy aft doors of the transport open. Four men in tan unadorned uniforms exit, stepping into the desert sand. Their worn-in clothes are dirty and inconsistent. One wears a tan cap, and the others have close trimmed hair. The men turn and clear the hold of the transport. Moving crates and containers, the figures rearrange equipment to make way for the items in my cargo hold. A wide-plank at the edge of the transport&#39;s bay acts as a ramp.</p>\n\n<p>With their cargo bay prepared and the ramp installed, two men fetch an old loading barrow. From deep inside the craft, they haul it out of the darkness, and in tandem, down the ramp. Placing it on the sand, one worker flips a switch on the handle, and it emits three long beeps. The barrow lifts itself, hovering above the dust. With three quick beeps, it confirms it&#39;s working correctly. The men grab it by the handle, gliding it toward my ship.</p>\n\n<p>Near the front of the craft, a figure wearing a brown jacket over the same weathered uniform hops out of the cockpit. It slides down a small ladder, landing with ease in the hot desert floor. Looks back on the craft, it sees the men at the other side preparing the hold, and examines the hull of her transport. While inspecting it, the figure removes their brown jacket and holds it under her arm. Once satisfied with the situation, she approaches me.</p>\n\n<p>I move for a moment out of the protective shade of my ship. The sun pierces my eyes, and the transport is hissing and cooling. The pilot walks over to me while looking at my old freighter and me over. Her eyes are that of a skeptical stranger, trying to gather as visual much information as possible.</p>\n\n<p>She speaks to me in a loud, hearty voice, using the lingua-franca of the empire and the region, Athylian. &quot;Ga meene?&quot; She asks about the shipment, her voice straining over all the commotion. Iq move back, once again, shielding the sun from my eyes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Makkam.&quot; I respond with the Athylian affirmative, yelling over the sound of the transport still winding down.</p>\n\n<p>She whistles and motions at the four others to grab the crates from <em>Opportune</em>. The woman proceeds closer to me, stopping before reaching the cooling shade under the wing of my ship. She&#39;s watchful and cautious, noticing my holstered sidearm, and rare pre-war ocular sight. A typical transaction in the frontier, nobody is ever at ease. Holding her hand above her eyes, she tries to block the sun. Her face is worn, skin tanned and cracked from the sun, with buzz-cut hair and brown eyes.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s much quieter, closer now. She converses with me in my native Athylian, the same language she greeted me in over the sound of her craft powering down.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Were you stopped in the coreward regions? Was your ship boarded?&quot; She asks, fearful our deal was compromised.</p>\n\n<p>I shake my head. She acknowledges and turns to her left, watching the crates leave my ship. The men load the boxes onto the cart, stacking them two high—the old barrow strains and dips for a moment, almost kissing the sand with the addition of each container, compensating for the added weight.</p>\n\n<p>One trip is all it takes. Once the hovering cart is full, the men haul the crates across the desert floor and onto the ramp of the transport&#39;s cargo bay. Fighting the wind, they shield their faces with their arms. Few have donned bandannas and are using them as dust masks. The men are strong and lean but appear unaccustomed to these conditions.</p>\n\n<p>I hear the rumbling pulse engines of the skiffs behind me, tearing a line through the settled dust. The riders return, slow once more, and give the woman a quick hand signal. She waves while turning her torso to face them. They speed away, pulse engines ripping and pounding, hungry to get ahead of the transport once again.</p>\n\n<p>She yells at her crew while quickening back to her ship. &quot;I want us off-world before nightfall!&quot; She sounds as though she is a veteran chief. Someone tough. Someone who leads from the trenches.</p>\n\n<p>The rough-looking men bark an acknowledgment, fishing loading, retract the ramp, and seal the doors to the transport as they board. </p>\n\n<p>Jogging back to her craft, she stops at the cockpit ladder. The woman passes me an unenthusiastic wave and hops up. Once her dusty boots leave the top rung, she retracts the narrow metal ladder and seals the cockpit door.</p>\n\n<p>The engines wind up, and the craft lifts above the sand blowing dust in all directions. The transport strains and makes a lumbering right turn and speeds off after the skiffs. A rooster tail of dusty red smoke chases it across the sand. They&#39;re gone, and it&#39;s quiet. Once again, I&#39;m alone with the sound of the dry wind blowing over the wasteland. Music for the sand dancing through the ruins sings aloud in the landscape.</p>\n\n<p>I enter my ship <em>Opportune</em>, and a dark, empty cargo hold greets me. The aft doors groan and lock closed, keeping out the grit and sand and heat of the desert atmosphere. I head down the short ramp and onto the deck of the main cargo area and pick up my discarded outer garments. Overhead lighting senses my movement, flicks on, and illuminates the bay. Loose cargo straps are strewn about, still clinging to their tie-downs. Years of hauling god-knows-what have worn and stained the curved bulkhead and non-slip metal floor.</p>\n\n<p>At the forward end of the hold lies a narrow metal staircase with a thin, waist-high railing. The stairs go up a bit, wrapping around to a raised platform connected to the forward hatch. I collect the pile of outerwear and the empty water container from the deck and tuck them under my arm. My footsteps emit a muted echo in the emptiness, amid the soft hum of the auxiliary power units and ventilation fans. She&#39;s in sleep mode.</p>\n\n<p>Through the forward hatch are <em>Opportune&nbsp;</em>&#39;s two non-cargo decks. The upper deck consists of ship&#39;s quarters. There lay a small galley and head, two equipment rooms, varied access panels, and of course, the bridge. The below deck is accessible via a floor panel at the base of the forward hatch. Descending the ladder would reveal a steamy maze of pipework. Ducting, machinery, and engineering compartments obscure the path to the main reactor and engineering workshop.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s a Gipsy-class light freighter, a pre-war workhorse. In her day, she had a crew of six to eight people, although a single pilot can handle her fine. During the War of the Seven Colonies, she was a blockade runner. Small, fast, and packed with supplies, she would make runs from the colonial outpost on Cevos Prime. She sailed through the mighty imperial echelon at Port Charity, evading the king&#39;s finest. News broke when she docked during those dangerous times. Not all blockade bandits were so lucky. The Athylian empire made a clear example of each of them when they got the chance. In some small way, <em>Opportune</em> was a beacon of hope for the revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Through the narrow forward passage, I toss my dusty bag and apparel into my unkempt quarters. In a moment, I reach the bridge. It&#39;s dim and quiet. I remember I kept the exterior shutters closed in case a sand storm came up. The bridge is in sleep mode, with nothing but essential systems active. In the dull green and amber light, I can make out the silhouettes of the four worn-out command chairs. As I move forward, my eyes adjust to the darkness. They see torn leather, exposed padding, and a tattered seat harness. I&#39;m reminded of her age and her legacy. I approach the helm seat, and once more, wake her up.</p>\n\n<p>I collapse into the beat-up captain&#39;s chair on the dimly lit bridge, feeling spent. My skin is sticky with sweat and grime, but I know I must get the cooling systems running. I stretch out a hand, flipping the battery switch to turn on the power. The sound of circuits engaging fills the room, and the lights flicker on, humming a familiar tune.</p>\n\n<p>The cooling fans kick in, blowing cool air over my skin, evaporating the sweat and dust. I slip off my shawl, feeling the moist fabric peel away from my neck. The cool air is a relief.</p>\n\n<p>With a clearer mind, I ready the ship for takeoff. The reactor can be a challenge in this heat, but I trust my instincts and shut it down earlier to avoid overheating the heat exchangers. I ease open the throttle, feeling the coolant flow and the reactor warm up. It takes a little coaxing, but soon enough, she&#39;s powered up and ready to go, like a desert beast awakening from its slumber.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>As the bronze atmosphere thins and wanes, the roar of lift-off quiets into a whisper. The orbital direction system audibly alerts me as orbital insertion completes. It&#39;ll be my turn to take the controls soon.</p>\n\n<p>With a simple click, I unbuckle the three-point restraint harness. It weighs a little less now. The gravity on Bowenn II is stronger than the artificial gravity my ship generates. The buckle slides away and falls, but is too short of hitting the worn metal decking and dangles taught. I disengage the orbital director and get comfortable. <em>Opportune</em> is under my control. Moments later, the shuttered heat shield protecting the thick composite-glass windows automatically open. I take a moment to enjoy the quiet and the view after the thundery darkness of atmospheric escape.</p>\n\n<p>Through the bridge windows, the planet&#39;s dry seabeds speck the landscape. A green and blue crescent sunrise divides the planet. The night side is pitch black, and I&#39;m reminded Bowenn II is deserted, save for an assortment of isolated tribes living in the far north near the polar ice cap.</p>\n\n<p>These native nomadic tribes ebb and flow with the cycle of the vast glaciers and lakes thawing and freezing. Traveling south in the winter, before the tundra freezes solid, they migrate and sustain themselves on roots, tubers, and the stalks of hearty Nobu plant. During the spring months, they travel north to hunt game foraging on the freshly thawed and blossoming vegetation. This planet has only a mere sliver of a livable surface at any given time. These tribes travel hundreds of kilometers each season to make the most of it.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of planets and moons in this region fall under the control of small local governments or indigenous civilizations. The Athylian empire does not dominate this region. They see no value in its people or resources, and even if they did, they would be spread too thin at the moment to capitalize on it. The planets here are lifeless, frozen worlds. Most have atmospheres that are toxic to human life. Or they have soul-crushing gravity with liquid metal oceans. There are exceptions, though, Bowenn II being one of them. Compared to some other planets in the region, it&#39;s desert hellscape is downright pleasant.</p>\n\n<p>The desert planet shrinks in the forward window. On instinct, I position <em>Opportune</em> for faster-than-light travel. Her attitude control thrusters stick a little before they warm-up, but I hardly notice anymore. As she pivots, the dusty sphere slips off the starboard bow and off into the blackness of the void.</p>\n\n<p>With the planet is behind me, there is nothing but stars ahead. There&#39;s a bright point of light in the distance. It&#39;s the fourth planet of this system, also known as Hurwish Karax. A class IV gas giant, unpopulated and uninhabitable — one of those terrible places with a toxic ammonia atmosphere, -120° gS in the daytime. Ironically, in its orbit is a lovely tidally locked tropical moon people love to vacation on called Ophistess.</p>\n\n<p>I recall my short but indulgent time spent swimming in the warm, salty ocean of the wild moon Ophistess. My mind flashes to the days spent hiking the lush Solumecha valley. The night when the sky illuminated by only the gas planet as it loomed so low in the air. In the dim light, bobbing in the calm sea, I remember seeing see my clothes I had left in a small pile on the deserted shore, along with my hiking pack and boots and socks. I can still feel the damp sand between my toes as the waves washed gently above them.</p>\n\n<p>I know this star system well, it&#39;s a great place if you don&#39;t want anyone to find you, yet I find myself here all too often. My unique line of work takes me to these sorts of places. Again and again, finding scoundrels, smugglers, pirates, and the like. What category would the people I&#39;ve met fall into? And what were the curious blue and white banner they flew so proudly?</p>\n\n<p>I swing over to the navigator&#39;s table and double-check my destination. Port Bethany, a large, free port in the Orylia system.</p>\n\n<h1>11</h1>\n\n<p>I set my half-full teacup on the navigator&#39;s table, and buckle in. The worn strap tightened over my shoulders. The drink is from a recent trip; I was delivering a pack of foul-smelling Boralian wild spigs to a farming settlement out in the Loreos system. The farmers there cultivate an excellent gelded tea — I made it a point to store some in my galley.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike some of the more popular teas in the outer territories, the Loreos variety has no psychoactive side effects. Most teas traded or sold contain some amount of oneirogens or other psychoactive compounds, and some can be highly addictive. Across the region, tea is consumed recreationally, for relaxation and meditation, or in some cultures, for entheogenic use. Trade of tea leaves is highly controlled, regulated, and taxed in imperial trade regions, and the Athylian empire earns a considerable profit from the export of its renowned teas. </p>\n\n<p>Tea is an important cultural, social, and economic activity, in Athylia and in many other places in the galaxy. All kinds of Athylian shops feature cups for brewing tea. The cups are often ornate and beautiful, decorated with paint, decorated with precious metals, and designs.</p>\n\n<p>The imperial colony of Ogma produces what&#39;s widely accepted as the highest quality blend in the galaxy. It&#39;s known as the <em>King&#39;s Own Red Olata</em>. The leaves are selected for their strong psychotropic qualities, as well as its exquisite, deep herbal flavor. It&#39;s quite sought after. Red Olata has the hypnotic ability to alter perception, mood, and consciousness—it&#39;s well worth the money—if you can afford it.</p>\n\n<p>The tea trade has always been a point of contention with the seven colonies. Early on, tea cultivation, processing, and export formed the foundation of the colonial economies. The earliest settlers took sizable loans from the metropole to establish their plantations and sold the tea almost exclusively back to the imperial homeland on Athylia. Their thirst was insatiable. Due to the imperial government being the primary importer, they had near-total control of the price, and also, being in control of the loans meant they had power over the plantation owners. This frustrating power struggle caused accusations and conspiracy theories leading up to the war.</p>\n\n<p>Checking the ship&#39;s clock, it looks like I made a good time. As expected, thirty-seconds before FTL shutdown we begin hitting some rough chop. I switch to manual control. The space-time envelope is closing and forcing my craft and me into the present. I take the helm and hold her steady, she fights and slips a bit. Pushing harder on the controls, The bow angles into the turbulence, and we ride the wake of <em>Opportune</em>&#39;s future self. </p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s rattling and buffeting when at FTL shutdown there&#39;s a brilliant flash, and we break away from light speed to arrive in the present. After a quick post-jump check of the charts, I confirm we&#39;ve reached waypoint TRIDENT in the Orylia system, Perseus region, about three luminal distances from Port Bethany.</p>\n\n<p>Safely out of light-speed travel, I loosen the straps, unbuckle, and align the ship for an intercept course with Port Bethany. One quick manual burn of the main engines puts us in before nightfall, about three hours from now. Sliding back over to the navigator&#39;s station, I check the local chart and transcribe the docking frequency into the transmitter.</p>\n\n<p>Staring out the forward window, I watch the expanse of space sleepily. It&#39;s been a long day. And the cabin is quiet. I let loose a long relaxing sigh. &quot;Ahh,&quot; I say to my lukewarm tea, rewarding myself by savoring a long sip. The herbs have had a chance to open up. I taste fresh-cut plant stems, tar, and leather with a hint of stone fruits. I slowly breathe out across my tongue, appreciating the warm finish of lingering molasses and sun-dried raisins.</p>\n\n<p>I depress the lever at the base of the command chair with my foot. With a gentle click, the chair unlocks and is now allowed to swivel freely. Little by little, the weathered hinged seat naturally rotates to face the navigator&#39;s station. Once aligned, I place my feet on the table and cross my ankles.</p>\n\n<p>Sipping the Loreos blend, and wishing the tea was warmer, I watch the star-field through my bridge window. Although too far to see, the port ahead is an immense, sprawling space station, a floating city orbiting the Super-Terran planet Orylia Tetrad. Once known for its rich ores, and home to mining settlements who operated large foundries, the miners and metalworkers would send finished erovium, vellurium, and other raw metals to the orbiting port for sale via a space elevator.</p>\n\n<p>Orylia Tetrad is one of the planets in the Cruelean Belt possessing natural deposits of Kassre Molyli-9, a dense and coarse black metal. An unassuming ore, once refined to its purest, blackest form, KaMi-9 acquires an exotic electromagnetic property allowing it to emit gravitons, the fundamental particle of gravity. With the proper alignment of a high power induction field, this material becomes the critical fuel of gravity inducers. Usage over time degrades the material. It cracks and becomes brittle, spotted with ashen flakes. The spots indicate it and can no longer be used to exchange electricity for gravity, and the inducer needs to be refueled.</p>\n\n<p>KaMi-9 production on Orylia stopped long ago, and these foundries have been dark for years. The severed elevator shaft still hangs from the lower decks of the port, a reminder of the immense prosperity this region once knew. Today, Bethany is a free port. For better, or worse, it is unencumbered by imperial laws and taxes. There are no restrictions on who can come here, or what can be bought or sold here.</p>\n\n<p>The economic freedom of the port comes at a fair price. The Scoma family governs the port. They&#39;re an ill-famed group of crooks who gained control nearly seventy years ago after the regional government failed and dissolved. Before the war, the Perseus region&#39;s economy suffered a tremendous crash after a long period of unsustainable growth and prosperity. When the markets collapsed, the mining operations ceased, foundries were left abandoned, and the Oryilan government went bankrupt. The regional government lost control, riots erupted, the derelict station was looted, almost razed, and the thousands of miners and families were left to fend for themselves. </p>\n\n<p>The Scomas, seeing opportunity where others saw tragedy, took advantage of the dire situation. With the police force dead or dissolved, the station was lawless and wild, bandits began to salvage the resources and destroyed the cargo elevator. With ruthless pragmatism, the patriarch of the Scoma family, Teramo Scoma, systematically massacred the roving bandits. His able men, finely paid, fit and fearless, took no prisoners. He made deals with the leaders of the most feared groups, only to turn is back on them once he earned their trust.</p>\n\n<p>Scoma&#39;s power grab both terrified and relieved the people of the port. The raids were over, the bandits killed, and an eerie peace prevailed. However, a darker, more sinister power filled the void left by the chaos. After securing the stores of precious ore and establishing order via brutal force, the Scoma family took complete control. With the station&#39;s public doubting they can trust the mob, Licor Scoma called for an election, while filling the ticket with dirty politicians and a crooked sheriff.</p>\n\n<p>Pulling the strings of the marionette they&#39;ve designed, the family&#39;s only concern these days is profiting from merchants, travelers, and gamblers while taking their portion of imperial coin. Neglected by its, selfish owners, Bethany is in desperate need of a complete teardown and overhaul. The power and life support systems are overworked, and only a fraction of the port&#39;s gravity units are working at any given time. It&#39;s not uncommon to find weak gravity areas on the station, where one can find an unexpected spring in their step, or where when dropped, a thick wrench floats like a falling leaf to the floor.</p>\n\n<p>I swing back to face front in the old command chair. It&#39;s rotation mechanism locks into place. A male voice crackles over the docking frequency &quot;Unknown rider, unknown rider. Identify yourself immediately.&quot; The voice has a weak Perseid accent, the dominant language of the region.</p>\n\n<p>Startled, I scramble to put on my headset — I wasn&#39;t expecting to make contact with the port sentries until I was closer. In my hastiness, the thin metal of my headset gets caught in my hair, and I feel a twinge in my scalp.</p>\n\n<p>I adjust the small microphone to my mouth and try to make contact with Bethany at TRIDENT. I rub my head in frustration as I wait for a response. Light static fills my headset and I adjust the squelch to try and clear it. I scan the cockpit window for any other ships in the area, but see nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I try again to reach Bethany, making it clear that I am at TRIDENT and intend to dock. But again, I am met with silence. Finally, a crackled voice comes through my headset, telling me to hold my position at waypoint TRIDENT.</p>\n\n<p>The response did not come from the guards on the post. &quot;Understood.&quot; I reply, not expecting a response from whoever they are.</p>\n\n<p>In a panic, I grab the controls and issue a solid reverse burn. I&#39;m thrown forward as we slow down, and I have to fight to stay in the command chair. Laying off the throttle eases the reaction forces, and I settle back as she comes to a dead stop in space. Brushing the hair out of my face and tucking it behind the headset, I lean far forward, hunting once more through the full window of the bridge. The planet in the distance slips to the starboard. We&#39;re spinning slightly due to the reverse burn.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What could this be?&quot; I whisper aloud. The voice over the COMM is an Athylian detachment. Two long, sleek imperial corvettes descend from above. They position themselves on either side of <em>Opportune</em>, straight off the bow, about two ship&#39;s lengths. Their hulls, gleaming white, and marked with scarlet red imperial insignia. With my hands on the control thrusters, I realign to face the planet and the station ahead.</p>\n\n<p>One Corvette comes about, while the other holds position off my bow. The curious imperial ship does a slow, full circle around <em>Opportune</em>, scanning the hull with a bright searchlight. The light glides back and forth. As the corvette completes the inspection, the beam shines directly into the bridge. I cover my eyes to block the white light. The bulkhead has hard, dark shadows cast against it. The light shuts off. It takes a moment for my eyes to readjust to the darkness of space. Gradually the Corvette pulls forward back to the intercept position off my bow, her reaction driver&#39;s puffing wisps of fine white mist. </p>\n\n<p>I blink for a moment, and my cockpit turns dark as the stars are blotted out. Directly above <em>Opportune</em> descends a polished imperial brigantine, with the familiar scarlet markings of the Athylian empire. As she passes, I spot her name, <em>Blackmore Ketch</em>. The silent brigantine is not armed. Instead, she&#39;s an executive transport ship. The empire traded her weaponry for luxury, and she relies on her escort corvettes for protection. It is a is a fine-looking vessel. Even from here, I can see the wealth of the empire reflected in her clean, smooth lines. Her hull is white, with crimson highlights along her midsection, imperial colors abound. The ship&#39;s running lights brighten the interior, silhouetting the crew in the windows of the brigantine&#39;s bulging belly.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ketch</em> is transporting imperial barons, noblemen, sent to negotiate with the Scoma family. Their goal: tighten the imperial grip on one of the largest free ports in the Cruelean Belt. On their homeworlds, they act as if visiting the port is torture. Complaining to the heads of state about the decrepit conditions of such an &quot;uncivilized, unclean and dangerous anchorage&quot; — when in reality they much enjoy the services Port Bethany has to offer, with its gambling, bars, and lounges, and of course, sex. It&#39;s not uncommon for a drunken baron to stumble through the alleyways after a round of heavy gambling, and an equally heavy round of doling out unwanted advances towards the men and women of the port.</p>\n\n<p>One may also find a group of harlots loitering in the most exclusive clubs, looking to please the imperial elite and to garner imperial coin. The most tempting of them all are given open access to wait for their johns in the lavish staterooms aboard the executive ships. This wasn&#39;t always the case. Wartime proved to be quite dangerous for the Athylian nobility that visited the port. Colonial assassins masqueraded as high-end prostitutes. The port police would find poisoned aristocrats days, even weeks dead, slumped in an access tunnel — or blinded, half-naked, and mangled in a garbage shoot.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the colonies employed such savage tactics appalled the empire. These merciless assassins, may have caused more psychological, rather than physical damage but caused the emperor himself to decree a wartime ban on all leisure cruises to free ports. But the story of Bethany&#39;s wicked assassins died out, and now, the aristocracy once again returned to the seedy streets of Port Bethany to lay apportion their coin.</p>\n\n<p><em>Blackmore Ketch</em> moves forward with her corvette escorts in loose formation. I decided to give them some distance, as I tend to limit my amount of run-ins with imperial warships. The ships continue to move ahead without adjusting course, and begin to climb the planet&#39;s gravity well, with the corvettes taking the lead. I follow at a respectful distance. It&#39;s not long before they pass over the horizon, like a dark cloud blotting out the dim light of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>To them, Bethany is just a misunderstood seductress , promising the pleasures of her embrace to the empire, yet always fleeing their advances. I muse about the attitude, and I come to understand their fear. The rise of independent colonies — &#39;free ports&#39; — and their tendency to create their own governments and markets, did not sit well with the empire. Athylia managed to suppress the first group of independent worlds. They were only too happy to bring these rebellious states under tighter control. As far as they were concerned, these worlds were part of the empire, and they would fall back in line. Bethany, however, was a different problem.</p>\n\n<p>She proved to be a thorn in the empire&#39;s side. The empire needed to find a way to assimilate Bethany and her activities into the empire — to bring her under control. This is why Imperial Barons are being sent. I&#39;m certain there is some sort of agreement to be made with the Scoma family on how best to do this.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>With the imperials passing over the horizon, I continue to burn towards the dim horizon. With Orylia and it&#39;s three small moons floating in the distance, I sit back and listen to the activity on the local frequencies while watching the imperial ships sail toward the planet.</p>\n\n<p>I catch a deep-voiced news program mid-sentence, &quot;...The latest attack, upon a listening station in the Scorpius Nebula, has resulted in the injury of eighty-seven of our brave soldiers and the loss of twelve lives. It is not yet known if this attack bears any connection to the coordinated assault upon Port Charity that took place–&quot; The voice cuts out abruptly as I switch to the docking frequency.</p>\n\n<p>The imperial group moves further, and the tea lower in my cup. Finishing my drink , the static of the docking frequency lulls me into a trance. The thoughts stop me in my tracks, and I open my eyes and hear <em>Lamirand History</em> announcing her presence on the frequency. She&#39;s an old pre-war passenger ship and is arriving from the Corvus system. No doubt full of colonists eager to resupply and trade. Next, the heavy freighter <em>Dauphin Royal</em> is departing for the Hydrus region, carrying mail and basic commodities under the commission of Athylia.</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> sails under no flag, a privateer. However, there are plenty of captains in the belt who will settle for a low-paying commission under the scarlet banner of the empire. It&#39;s a steady job, and it&#39;s safe. Hauling mail from one rock to another? I don&#39;t know how you could do that and not feel like there&#39;s more to the galaxy, more to explore – more to life.</p>\n\n<p>On the docking channel, I hear a familiar voice. Dusty Hammond of the <em>Normandie Place</em>, coming in for repairs. What kind of trouble did he get himself into this time? Dusty is no stranger to the empire of Athylia. After being boarded countless times, the imperial police practically had access codes to his ship. He&#39;s been shot, held a prisoner in not one, but two imperial brig ships, and almost chased to the center of the galaxy and back.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t remember a time he hasn&#39;t had a bounty on his head. If he runs into whoever is on those Corvettes, they&#39;ll be exchanging more than words. I adjust my headset and broadcast in the clear.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<em>Normandie Place</em>, <em>Opportune</em> seven-one, you sound weary old friend. Fly safe.&quot; I call.</p>\n\n<p>I hear static for a moment until a crackled voice breaks the noise. &quot;Amal, is that you? Good to h–&quot; Static interrupts his transmission.  &quot;— and she&#39;ll hold together.&quot; He sounds happy to hear a friend.</p>\n\n<p>I am broadcasting in the clear, careful not to cause any suspicion. &quot;From the sound of things, I believe a tower visual check might be in order&quot; I say, hoping he&#39;ll make at least one trip around the station and see the imperial corvettes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Will do. <em>Normandie</em>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Fly true.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Dusty receives his landing clearance for the repair dock, and I&#39;m not far behind him. Minutes later, I contact Bethany&#39;s dock master and begin the approach.</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> nears the space city, as one of the twin suns of the Orylia system slips behind the planet in a pale blue sunset. Port Bethany was designed to make use of a space elevator; therefore, it keeps a geostationary orbit directly above the planet&#39;s equator. They both share the same 49-hour day-night cycle. The station cannot generate solar power during the night cycle and enforces mandatory power restrictions until sunrise. While in low-power mode, the port shuts down almost all it&#39;s interior lighting, forcing its inhabitants to rely on personal portable lanterns and power generators. Other systems such as heat, waste disposal, and transportation also power down in night mode. By sunrise, the temperature inside gets to a chilly 10° gS.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m cleared for landing in bay four, one of the smaller bays. On my way in, I didn&#39;t see <em>Blackmore Ketch</em> docked anywhere, although I&#39;m sure she&#39;s nearby. Ships of her size can&#39;t dry dock at Bethany. Instead, they use interconnecting airlocks and attach an external umbilical to transfer power, fuel, and waste.</p>\n\n<p>The wide doors of the bay are marked with a white &quot;4&quot; on the exterior. I arrive at the closed bay as the doors are opening. I smoothly position my ship facing the doors, watching the now red approach light inside to turn steady green. The doors stop moving at their fully open position, and the approach light indicates it&#39;s safe to enter the bay.</p>\n\n<p>I steer my ship into the docking station and land it. Inside my ship, the control panel shows that we have made contact with the ground. My ship, Opportune, is now safely on the deck of landing bay four. After checking that we have enough fuel, I shut down the engines and pumps.</p>\n\n<p>Through the windows on the bridge, I see the large doors of bay four closing. These doors are wide and narrow, with a yellow warning stripe around the edges. Red lights flash and a loud horn sounds, telling us that the bay is about to become breathable without a spacesuit. On the control panel, I activate the magnetic locks to hold Opportune securely in place on the landing area, in the center of a faded grey number four painted on the deck.</p>\n\n<p>Still sitting in my seat, I press a button. The ship gives a sudden jolt, and I feel it shaking down to the landing struts. The empty teacup on my table jumps and clatters. This feeling means that I have turned off the gravity systems on Opportune, and transferred control to the docking bay.</p>\n\n<p>Only after the jolt is it safe to unbuckle — gravity contrasts are dangerous. I&#39;ve been thrown out of my seat before during a landing when the transfer couplers in bay nine were worn out. This part of the galaxy, Cerulea, could more good gravity technicians, but many tradespeople and skilled workers are employed under the crown, where their work follows the discretion of the empire. Lately, Athylia has been more responsive to issues of the port, a strange change of heart for them.</p>\n\n<p>The harness falls away, and I stand and stretch a bit. I don&#39;t know what, or whom those corvettes were looking for. I decide it&#39;s best not to stand out. I slip out of the bridge and into my quarters where I find an old dark coat. It&#39;s warm, and I throw it on — I&#39;m now dressed in my typical &quot;keeping warm and hiding from imperial eyes&quot; attire. It&#39;s long and hangs well past my waist—about to my knee, and conceals my weapon.</p>\n\n<p>Although not outright illegal, carrying personal firearms is generally frowned upon in most ports, and more so in the planetary colonies. Port Bethany, though, is an exception. The whole damn place is on the wrong side of the tracks. Taking no chances, I touch the hammer of my sidearm <em>Reason to Believe</em>, ensuring it&#39;s secure in the leather holster on my hip.</p>\n\n<p>I make a mental checklist of what I&#39;m here to do, reminding myself there are imperial warships docked around the corner, and they seem to be on the prowl. &quot;Meet Malik. Gather supplies and get out.&quot; I whisper to myself while checking an empty leather rucksack, and putting it on one shoulder as I step out of the ship&#39;s quarters.</p>\n\n<p>The sound of the forecastle ventilation fans fades as I walk to the aft doors. The bridge is behind me, and through the forward hatch, I turn to head down the stairs to the main cargo hold. I flip open the cover for the door controls, and press and hold OPEN for three-seconds. The aft doors unlock and whirr open. Dust and sand fall from above as its parts, a souvenir of my time in the desert. I adjust my coat for a better fit, I know how chilly it can get, even if the sun has been down for only an hour or two.</p>\n\n<p>The landing area is about as soiled and worn out like every other old rust-bucket that comes through here. Along the wall opposite the heavy doors is a row of narrow, air-tight closets. Once the main doors open, the entire bay is exposed to the vacuum of space, these closets protect sensitive instruments. The storage closets contain discarded part containers, tools, equipment, fire extinguishers, and anything else you need to keep a starship running. In front of me is a wide fireproof door leading into the common areas of the port. A sign above reads &quot;BEWARE EXHAUST&quot; in Perseid, an ancient language that&#39;s common in the region. There is a smaller translation below in my language, Athylian. I read it and think to myself exhaust is hardly the most dangerous thing here.</p>\n\n<p>I pass through the bay doors, listening to <em>Opportune</em>&#39;s aft door shut behind me, and traverse the short, unadorned docking platform connector passing flocks of people conversing, and going about their business. I head up a wide curved ramp, entering the brackish area where port dwellers and weary travelers begin to mix. Along the path are large hand-painted advertisements for local port businesses. Traders attempt to lure travelers as soon as they come off their ships, pushing their wares, soliciting, hawking, cooing. The bargainers are peddling small sodium lamps, packaged food, and other cheap imported goods. I ignore their offers, staying focused ahead. They wouldn&#39;t have noticed me anyhow, too distracted by the wide-eyed passengers who have arrived by way of the passenger steamer <em>Lamirand History</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The lower level connector ends, and I arrive in the sprawling market district known as Breehl. The area lies in a massive atrium with a dark, geodesic dome ceiling. Long narrow windows line the top edge dome. The slender windows are cracked and chipped, while some are no longer windows at all — too damaged, they were sealed off and never replaced. The atrium, once a holding area for hundreds of thousands of tons of raw metals, now holds dense rows of homes, stores, and shops. There&#39;s a double-wide street running down the middle of the district. This well-traveled boulevard has narrow alleyways and passages branching off into Breehl&#39;s darker corners.</p>\n\n<p>The center street is lined with slender lighting pillars, that lead to a central structure where the space elevator once unloaded. Resourceful vendors and townspeople have placed small red and orange colored lamps along the streets, some hang them from the disabled lampposts, finding a use for them a purpose once more. As I approach the district, more and more lights illuminate the buildings and alleys, casing a warm red glow onto the dark buildings.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the structures here are two to three stories high and built out of wood and stone. The wood from the nearby wildwood moon Bolinas is inexpensive and readily available. The stone, once wastes from the mining operations below, arrived years ago after being carried up the now severed elevator. The shoddiest buildings of them all use parts of old starships, scraps, and bits of abandoned dreams of exploration. People came to this port looking for work in foundries on the planet&#39;s surface, sacrificing everything, including the ship they arrived on. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s an old city with a maze of narrow passages and shadowy alleys lost to history. Over the years, the district&#39;s boundaries meandered outward and grew organically, building on top of itself, never looking back. The architecture is of necessity and time. Structures here aren&#39;t sparse, they&#39;re lived in, loved, and used, and like the district itself, they too expanded and grew over time.</p>\n\n<p>Breehl is bustling and hurried as night is beginning. A multitude of people, some in heavy cloaks and jackets, with lanterns in hand, go about their business in the narrow and crowded alleys. Hawker stalls are set up for the night, with their exotic noodles and colorful Orylian crab steaming in the cold air. Their handmade signs are illuminated by white lamps in hopes of drawing attention, drawing in hungry crowds. </p>\n\n<p>The air above the stalls is fragrant with the sweet-savory smells of sausages, spicy stewed cabbage, and steaming fresh madro, a long white vegetable covered in juicy starchy kernels that pop with sweet milky liquid when eaten. At one of the more understated corner stalls, an older man with a grey and white striped cap stirs bubbling pots of chunky broths and stews. His soups are a spectrum of flavor and color. Some are red, yellow, and a local favorite is a bright blue with bits of fish and tongue. These inexpensive meals are served over pure grains such as arza. These dishes are hearty. They&#39;re best when eaten too hot to swallow.</p>\n\n<p>I walk past the stalls and down the center street, my objective in mind. I stop as a group of people on a balcony above laugh together. I look up as a slender figure takes a long drag of a cigarette, trying to keep warm. The cherry-red ember glows like the lanterns in the crowd and fades.</p>\n\n<p>Sodium lamps and lanterns are plentiful and inexpensive here. They&#39;re loved for their durability and especially for their low power consumption. These red-orange lamps are strung across the central street, and shopkeepers place them near their entrances, giving the district a warm amber glow amid the icy air.</p>\n\n<p>I skirt the side alley of the food stalls, minding my way as I go. Some of the alley&#39;s narrow spaces are dark and dank, unused by the vendors here. I can hear apartments above my head, each one stacked on top of the other until their topmost stories are covered so tall with buildings that they lie in the shadows of the main district. The smell of cooking lingers in the cold alcoves, the city&#39;s heavy air seems to suck the little energy from its inhabitants.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to meet a Tu named Malik, at a dingy bar called The Queen&#39;s Club. Malik runs the place, and we go back a long time. He&#39;s the one who arranged the Resnick deal. A reputable character, though he won&#39;t hesitate to take advantage of a fool when he can. It was two cycles ago that, while looking for work, he offered me 300 imperial marks to haul the goods. After a brief negotiation, I took the job for 400. I&#39;m no fool.</p>\n\n<p>Walking through the brisk air, I reach the center of the market district. There stands a round metal structure where the space elevator once delivered its valuables from the planet below. It&#39;s now a twisted and burned dome. It&#39;s frame painted and marred with graffiti, the old jewel of the system is now degraded to a pile of vandalized scrap.</p>\n\n<p>The area immediately surrounding the old elevator is a messy, boisterous, and worn out circle of gambling halls, casinos, brothels, and fume houses. Only a handful of food vendors dare encroach on the sacred territory of the dens of iniquity. With the long night only beginning, customers are sparse and sober. It will be another half-cycle before the circle, as it&#39;s called, gets into full swing.</p>\n\n<p>From the circle, I make a left between a Perseid-only men&#39;s club and a modest barroom. The saloonkeeper, a pale, balding man, sweeps his stoop, a vain task in this part of the district. It will be heavily soiled by sunup.</p>\n\n<p>The Queen&#39;s Club is in a dripping wet alley and sits next to a massage parlor named something in Perseid I can&#39;t make out. The sign above the bar is a stylized version of a card from an old Orylian card game. The lettering is scripted in red neon, and half of it doesn&#39;t light up. I head in to find Malik, and to find a drink. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s warm inside, but nearly empty. There are two men in the far corner, both wearing old-fashioned colonial caps. They&#39;re face down, unshaven, and they look like they&#39;ve been there for an entire cycle. An unfamiliar face is working at the bar. He&#39;s older, with a brown complexion, and turns to greet me with a blank expression and a full mustache.</p>\n\n<p>The walls of the Queen&#39;s club are adorned with the port&#39;s memorabilia, a visual heritage, some history of Port Bethany. There are photos of ships, transport and cargo carriers, also pictures of pre-war sports teams and celebrities. On the other side the bar, and the man with the mustache, is a giant, mounted Orylian crab, with a small golden placard on the bottom of the frame, I cannot discern from this distance. This kind of kitsch is Malik&#39;s idea. It&#39;s unique to this place, and I find it endearing.</p>\n\n<p>I sit on a stool and can hear water dripping outside through the partially opened window. A pipe must have burst somewhere above the street. The two men are grumbling indistinctly to each other behind me. The stool reeks of history. As rest my feet on the raised rail below the bar, I wonder how many deadbeats, scoundrels, traders, miners, captains, and privateers such as myself have taken a seat and taken to the drink here. Do the people I met on Bowenn come to places like this?</p>\n\n<p>I attempt to garner the old bartender&#39;s attention. After some time, he looks at me and nods, his chin lifting.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Zalara,&quot; I say, ordering a dark pour of distilled grains, usually arza, steeped in herbs and fermented for at least three lya. Doing the math in my head, it&#39;s aged for over 600 cycles — old stuff. The bartender subtly acknowledges my order, and pours me two fingers of brown liquid from a brown bottle, with a brown label. He sets the glass in front of me and replaces the bottle, saying nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I take the glass and pause for a moment, not lifting it. &quot;Malik. Have you seen him?&quot; I say with casual confidence.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He&#39;s out.&quot; The man says, being inexact. &quot;You&#39;re a friend of his?&quot; He asks while pulling a white towel from his waist.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal,&quot; I say, matching is vagueness in turn. I finish my drink in one gulp. It burns hot. The herbs finish strong.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Care for another?&quot; He asks, his words comb through his grey mustache as he wipes the counter, and replaces the now moistened towel on his waist.</p>\n\n<p>I slide my glass to him. He pours it a little heavier this time. I try to relax, but I&#39;m left wondering about the encounter with the corvettes from earlier. I shrug it off. Taking comfort knowing my old friend <em>Reason to Believe</em> is resting at my side. I take a sip. The liquor is fiery and herbal—a regional style. There is no sweetness to this drink at all, and its dry herbaceousness is not shy or subtle. Zalara and its stronger counterpart Zalara-Jah are the two drinks of choice in these parts, intense flavor and high proof. The Perseids drink to forget.</p>\n\n<p>Down the hatch.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The night goes on. Three drinks in, and there&#39;s no sign of Malik or my money. The Queen&#39;s Club is getting busy. Indiscriminate conversation fills the air. I can no longer hear the dripping outside, and the two grumbling men are slumped, sleeping at their table. A couple of local, working-class women have taken perch on the stools to my right. They&#39;re discussing their work at a local dynamo shop, business is good.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I hope it keeps up.&quot; One woman says. They click their glasses and go back to their conversation.</p>\n\n<p>The alcohol entrenches itself in my mind. I lose myself, endlessly searching the almost empty glass, listening to the machinists converse. My thoughts wander to the encounter with the <em>Blackmore Ketch</em>, the corvettes, the searchlight. I examine in my alcohol tinged mind what could cause them to be so interested, only to leave suddenly. I come up with nothing while swirling the swig of brown liquid at the bottom of my glass.</p>\n\n<p>Before I have a chance to get a refill, a hurried Tu enters the bar. He&#39;s bundled up in a thick coat and hat while searching through the thickened crowd. I recognize it&#39;s Malik and stand up — almost. More intoxicated than I had guessed, I wobble a bit. He spots me and hurries over as he takes off a grey knit wool cap revealing the typical pale blue freckled skin of a male Tu. </p>\n\n<p>Turning to him, I exclaim, &quot;Ah, look who it is. I have been waiting for you here all cycle.&quot; I poke him in his broad chest. &quot;And I hope you&#39;ve got my coin.&quot; I lose my train of thought while slurring my speech. &quot;Oh.&quot; I pause, swallow, and smile. &quot;I&#39;ve made a new friend,&quot; I say while winking and pointing my thumb back at the bartender. The mustached man looks at Malik and shrugs.</p>\n\n<p>Malik, the burly Tu touches me on the shoulder to help keep me steady. &quot;My dear, friend, listen. You must leave Breehl and Port Bethany.&quot; His piercing golden pupils stare into my dilated brown ones. He&#39;s serious. &quot;Imperial sentinels roam the station, seeking the captain of a ship that came upon us this day. My heart tells me it may well be the <em>Opportune</em>&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I instantly feel sober.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Back door.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>I swing from the barstool. I attempt to steady myself on wobbly feet. We hurry past the two passed out old-timers, and I grab one of their hats to use as a makeshift disguise. Snatching the cap, they both remain asleep. Malik and I slip through a narrow wooden door behind the bar. We enter a small storage room, he closes and locks the door behind us. The sound of the bar is muted here. There&#39;s crates of liquor, shelves of old glasses and metal kegs with hoses leading through the wall. The opposite end of the storage room has a rusted metal door with a heavy-looking crossbar.</p>\n\n<p>Malik moves the crates and boxes away from the rusted grey door and begins to fiddle with the lock. He&#39;s a tall, muscled creature. The padlock looks like a toy in his hands.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And you&#39;re certain it was I they were looking for?&quot; I ask, scared and drunk. &quot;<em>Normandie Place</em> is old as well, and arrived this morn.&quot; I say, referring to Dusty&#39;s ship and the fact it is far older than mine, and not to mention their history with him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Aye. I am certain.&quot; He stops working on the lock and turns to me, and pauses for a long moment. I look at him, sensing his seriousness. &quot;I must to tell you... the shipment to Bowenn. It was weapons. The kind of weapons I can only trust someone like you to deliver.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; After all, I&#39;ve done worse.</p>\n\n<p>He pauses. &quot;We have a plan.&quot; He explains.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Nonsense. Weapons? A plan? Who is this Resnick?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;A freedom fighter,&quot; Malik says patriotically.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Freedom fighter?&quot; my eyes widen as my voice rises. &quot;Opposing the <em>Athylian Empire</em>?&quot; I ask sarcastically. &quot;You must be bold, indeed. Why did you not share this with me?&quot; I scoff, profanely referencing the Athylian spiritual realm of evil and suffering, &quot;Dija.&quot; I&#39;m furious, cursing him with my hands on my unsteady hips, partly in anger, partly to balance myself.</p>\n\n<p>We pause for a moment, and he gathers his thoughts. &quot;Amal, I could not reveal this to you. You would not have gone through with it, and we desperately needed those weapons.&quot; He&#39;s trying not to anger any more than he already has.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I would not have dared to oppose them. You must know that those who defy them are doomed to death.&quot; I pause, gesturing towards the Tu with a stern gaze. &quot;...We need them&#39;? Who is this &#39;we&#39; of which you speak?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He says nothing and looks down slightly. The small gold key is shining in his oversized hand.</p>\n\n<p>I throw my hands up, nearly knocking the crooked hat off my head. &quot;You cannot be serious, Malik. You align yourself with <em>those</em>?&quot; I let out a bitter laugh, &quot;Bear in mind, my friend, they were defeated in battle nigh on thirty years ago, and the Empire shall not permit such a thing to happen again. Never. Even the seven colonies do not desire to see another war.&quot; I pause, allowing the weight of my words to sink in.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Resnick,&quot; I say, sighing and shaking my head. &quot;I cannot fathom how this man managed to persuade you to join his cause.&quot; I calm down for a moment, continuing with tenderness, I look at him. &quot;It&#39;s foolish. You know must know that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of the stories of the War of the Seven Colonies. The failed revolution. How over the four long lya of the war, each colony fell in order. Each resistance quelled like a bucket of water dumped on a match. Patriots who lived through it believe the territories were too unorganized, leaderless. They lacked unity in their tactics and decisions.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Things are not as they were, Amal. Cerulea is changing. We all will have to choose a side one day.&quot; He starts with the lock again and says, &quot;Some of us already have.&quot; Malik hints at the unthinkable, another terrible war, and what side he will be on.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I do not choose sides. I shall take your coin, but I ask only to be left in peace.&quot; I say, as the large Tu turns and finishes unlocking the door.</p>\n\n<p>The lock comes off, he puts it on the shelf to his left, lifts the crossbar and steps away from the now partly opened door. He reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a small black pouch with a drawstring pulled tight. He places it in my hand and closes my fingers around it. I feel thick metal coins through the plush dark cloth.</p>\n\n<p>Still holding my hand shut, he looks at me. &quot;Forgive me. It had to be you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m contemplative for a moment and break away from his large, blueish hand to stuff the money in my coat pocket and adjust my stolen hat.</p>\n\n<p>I move to the other side of him. &quot;You owe me.&quot; I say, slipping through the doorway into the cold night.</p>\n\n<p>Malik closes the door behind me. I walk down a narrow and wet alley. My pace is brisk. I hear the faint sounds of life in the district once more, amid the low rumble of the city. My hat is low, and my collar is high. I&#39;m trying to hide as much of my body as I can. I have no idea whom they were looking for, although I can only assume it&#39;s me. It strikes me, though, as it did before – Dusty Hammond may also be of some interest to Athylia. Aside from our comms earlier, I haven&#39;t spoken to him for some time. At least two lya ago, not since his involvement with an illicit mining operation deep in an imperial asteroid field.</p>\n\n<p>I splash through a shallow puddle, hands in my pockets. The alley is putrid and cold, my nose stings from the temperature and is repelled by the stench. Garbage cans line the path, overflowing spilling onto the lane, steeping their trash in the pools of muck created by the broken pipe above. A small, wiry, wrinkled man is puffing smoke in a doorway. With ragged clothes, he offers me a slickly toothless smile. His cough echoes through the passage as I lower my shoulders, hurrying past.</p>\n\n<p>Halfway down the alley, I hear voices from around the corner. I duck against the wall and trying not to be seen. In the pale light, four teenagers run across the alleyway. Small red lamps dangle from their backpacks as they gossip, laughing and carrying on. They pass, and I keep moving.</p>\n\n<p>I reach the main street and turn left. Far fewer people are out now, the district is calmer and colder than when I arrived. I pass a boisterous lounge and hear music and laughing. A man with a wiry beard behind a noodle stall turns his head and watches me pass. He&#39;s warming himself at a portable heater, waiting for his next customer. His hollow gaze follows me through the steam of his pots.</p>\n\n<p>On my side of the street, white flashlights emit from an alleyway, I instantly know it must be imperial soldiers. They turn to head down my side of the road and flick their lights out. I slow my pace, trying to act normal, looking down. <em>Reason to Believe</em> is loaded, holstered. If this goes south, I won&#39;t have time to fumble underneath my coat to grab it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m reminded of the Zalara as I attempt to steady my path. Under my coat, my body feels warmer than usual as the alcohol works its way through my core. My palms sweat in my pockets, and my feet waver at each awkward step. I slow my pace. My breathing. My mind.</p>\n\n<p>Two pairs of dark grey knee-high boots approach. I lift my head to look up and notice they&#39;re wearing double-breasted white coats. Red trim and two rows of black buttons garnish these uniforms. Their hats are also white, with red trim with a small gold falcon in the middle. I can hear their slung rifles clinking with their stride. It&#39;s difficult to make out any facial features of the men in the darkness, especially at this distance.</p>\n\n<p>Passing them on my left, I catch a glimpse of one of the soldier&#39;s uniforms, a piece reflecting in the dim red light. It&#39;s an intricate design with downward-facing golden chevrons, and a falcon perched on a globe. The device is intricate and detailed. A reminder of the attention the empire pays to certain details. Quickening my pace, I don&#39;t look back.</p>\n\n<p>I leave Breehl behind me. Down the ramp and across the docking platform connector — I&#39;m nearly running. To my right is the long row of landing bay hatches. I pass bays one, two, and three to arrive where the beast <em>Opportune</em> lay sleeping. Bay four. Before entering, I stop the entryway, poking my head in to make sure it&#39;s clear.</p>\n\n<p>No movement. <em>Opportune</em>&#39;s aft doors are sealed, and it&#39;s quiet in the bay. She&#39;s resting atop the large number &quot;4&quot; painted on the worn surface of the hanger. I step into the hanger bay.</p>\n\n<p>The small access panel on the starboard landing strut is illuminated. Ready to accept my gate codes, I head straight for it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Halt!&quot; I hear the command from behind me. I&#39;m too far from <em>Opportune</em> to make a break for it. I check for cover, something to duck behind – there&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m caught in the open, forced to put my hands up. &quot;Turn around slowly; keep your hands above your head.&quot; The voice commands.</p>\n\n<p>Standing before me is four imperial soldiers, all wearing the same white uniform as the ones I saw before. Two of them have their imperial made rifles pressed against their shoulders and trained on my body. One of them has a group of golden chevrons on his shoulder. I assume that&#39;s a leader.</p>\n\n<p>The soldier closest to me begins to recite a familiar phrase, &quot;By the power of the King&#39;s Peace and Security Decree of 1809 Aldeos and by the command of his majesty the King, you are now in his custody.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I roll my eyes as he finishes the recitation. One of the soldiers walks behind me. Pressing his boot into the back go my leg, he forces me to my knees while keeping my hands together with his own. He disarms me. Reaching under my cloak taking <em>Reason to Believe</em> out of its holster, and hands it to another guard.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Wrong move,&quot; I whisper as <em>Reason to Believe</em> shines in the cold light of the bay, glinting in the stranger&#39;s hand.</p>\n\n<p>My threat did not affect him. Ignoring me, he places irons on my hands. He then tucks my arms behind my back and lifts me to my feet. The two soldiers sling their weapons and grab me by the forearm. The third inspects <em>Reason to Believe</em>, clearing and unloading it. We leave the hangar bay together and turn right, away from Breehl, and down the long dock-way.</p>\n\n<p>Imperial soldiers are religious, disciplined, and well respected throughout the empire. However, their fault lies in their lack of creativity. I would argue they lack a sense of <em>inventiveness</em>. All their training and rigor never prepared them for the unorthodox tactics the rebellion applied during the War of the Seven Colonies.</p>\n\n<p>The imperial soldiers march me down the dock-way, their grip on my arms tight and unyielding. They are all tall and broad-shouldered, their white uniforms crisp and immaculate. Their faces are stoic, their expressions blank. They are the epitome of discipline and rigor, the very embodiment of the empire.</p>\n\n<p>But as we walk, I can&#39;t help but wonder about their lives. How much of their time is spent in training, honing their skills and perfecting their discipline? How much of their time is spent away from their families and loved ones, serving the empire? What kind of toll does this take on them, both physically and mentally?</p>\n\n<p>I can see the strain etched in the lines of their faces, the exhaustion in the way they carry themselves. They are soldiers, yes, but they are still human. They are still people with families and dreams and hopes. And the empire is a demanding master, one that takes much and gives little in return.</p>\n\n<p>We pass through the bustling streets of Breehl, the imperial soldiers leading me like a prisoner through the crowds. The people of Breehl eye us warily, their expressions a mix of fear and resentment. They know the empire&#39;s ways, they know the price of dissent. They know that the empire is not to be trifled with.</p>\n\n<p>We turn left the dock-way widens. The dim hall splits, becoming two levels. Along the lower level, bulkhead lay three airlock doors with small round windows. Above each entry is a sign in red letters proclaiming &quot;DANGER AIRLOCK,&quot; and again, there&#39;s a translation below. We approach the first airlock, and the soldier who spoke before enters an access code on the panel to the right of the door. It unlocks with a metallic thud. The forward-most soldier opens the airlock, and it discharges a quick hiss while the pressure equalizes in the gantry way.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Move,&quot; the soldier behind me says. He pushes on my shoulder, forcing me forward. I stumble into the airlock, no longer feeling the cold breeze against my skin. The airlock is small, only allowing three people to stand side by side. The gantry outside the airlock is just as small. The four soldiers stand in a line outside, their rifles drawn and held at the ready.</p>\n\n<p>We enter the imperial corvette. From the looks of it, the ship is crewed by about fifty people. It&#39;s not a large vessel, one of the smaller classes in the imperial fleet, used for escort duty and orbital patrol and basic ship tending.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m led down the main corridor, the ceiling sloping high above us. The ship&#39;s cold metal floor is stained with moisture and oil, the lights above barely illuminating the murky darkness of the ship. The soldiers walk me through the crew quarters, a long narrow room with a set of beds on either side. There are no windows other than a single window at the end of the chamber, then down a narrow corridor to a small room somewhere on a lower deck of the ship, near the aft. </p>\n\n<p>The reactor and transformers were droning away, as I&#39;m looking around the squarish chamber. An imperial seaman, a low ranking sailor, directs me to sit in a metal chair near the middle of the room. She attaches my hand restraint to the lowest rung of the back. Leaving for a moment, she then returns with a small table and another chair in hand. They&#39;re creating an interrogation room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where am I?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>She ignores me. Instead, she sets down the table and the chair, leaves, and locks the door behind her. It&#39;s quiet in the room. The sound of the engines and reactors are left outside, inside is the sound of my breathing. The place is bare, metal bulkheads, no windows, with a polished dark floor and bright overhead tubular lights. With a wiggle, I check the crewman&#39;s work. I&#39;m not getting out. There&#39;s no give at all in my binds or the chair. I imagine she&#39;s done this before – if not, she needs a promotion.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine I&#39;ll be left alone to stew in my own thoughts. I wonder how long I&#39;ll be here. I&#39;m trying to figure out what they want with me as I stare at the table and the chair, the wall behind it, the door. Every few minutes figures pass by the frosted glass window in the door, but they don&#39;t pay attention to the room.</p>\n\n<p>A few hours pass, then a few more. For the most part, I&#39;m alone. Every now and then I can hear footsteps outside, or the sounds of distant voices. And then, after a long time, the door unlocks and opens.</p>\n\n<p>A wide imperial soldier enters. He has dark brown eyes, and thick dark brown hair in a military standard cut. He is a little short in his white uniform with red trim. The man is holding an open folder and is looking at it while entering without looking up. Standing, flipping through the pages, he&#39;s playing tough. I recognize the tactic.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal, Otelia R., age 27 lya. Born in the year 1810A-66 in the Ogma Tau mining outpost. I have not had the pleasure of visiting such a place myself, but I have heard tales of the horrid conditions in the Helion mines. A most unpleasant location, I&#39;m sure.&quot; He pauses and flips the first cream-colored page over. &quot;Smuggling, conspiracy, criminal possession of a weapon, and evading imperial police no less than... three times. And, as if that were not enough, aiding a known terrorist. Your crimes are many, Ms. Amal.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Captain.&quot; I correct him.</p>\n\n<p>He looks away from his folder and, finally, at me. Offended, he asks, &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You can call me <em>Captain</em>,&quot; I say, looking directly into his dark eyes.</p>\n\n<p>He turns to me and towers over me, his cold eyes piercing through me. &quot;I will address you as I see fit, Ms. Amal.&quot; His voice is cold and calculating, as if he is weighing every word before he speaks. &quot;You should consider yourself fortunate that I do not refer to you as a smuggler and a traitor, for that is what you are, and that is what you shall be dealt.&quot; His accent, indicative of his Perseid heritage, is more pronounced than that of the other soldiers present. It is clear that he is not fluent in this language.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I desire information, Ms. Amal.&quot; He leans closer, his gaze intense and intimidating. &quot;I want to know the purpose of your presence in Port Bethany. I want to know with whom you are meeting.&quot; His tone is one of command, and it is clear that he will not be denied.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is a free port. My business is my own.&quot; I answer, stoking his anger.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Have you any idea what is about to happen to you? You pathetic smugglers are all the same.&quot; He says in disgust. &quot;So pitiful, you&#39;re even willing to turn each other in for the measly amount of coin.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is this?&quot; I ask, laughing a bit, shaking my head with a smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Your so-called friend, what is his name? Hammond? Yes? He alerted us to your arrival some hours ago. Shame you won&#39;t be leaving anytime soon, you could ask him how little you&#39;re worth to him. How little it took for him to turn you in.&quot; He tells.</p>\n\n<p>I let it sink in for a moment. &quot;You vultures are all the same.&quot; I am filled with rage. My arms are tense, pulling the bindings tight against the ungiving chair.</p>\n\n<p>He leans in even closer, inches from my face. Teeth clenched, anger whispering he says, &quot;And as we speak we this port is falling into our control. Soon there will no place left in the galaxy for scum like you to hide — Captain.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Before he realizes it, I lean back to throw the full weight of my body at him, striking him in the bridge of his nose with the side of my forehead. It hurts like hell. He falls, stumbling, and gets up, shaking. His face turns ferocious, and it begins to bleed.</p>\n\n<p>Before I know what is happening, he slams me in the jaw with a closed-fist punch. It feels like a brick crashing into my skull, my entire body reels from the force of this strike. The chair nearly falls over with me in it, and I can taste blood.</p>\n\n<p>He takes a step back and winds up to take another swing. As he&#39;s coming down slow and hard, I move my head out of the way, his fist lands firmly onto the metal frame of the chair. His knuckle tears. He snarls in pain. Blind with anger, he reaches with both hands to grab me around my neck.</p>\n\n<p>The door bursts open. A blurry figure stands tall at the threshold. The interrogator with a bloody nose and broken knuckle snaps to attention. My eyes gradually un-blur, and my head stops whirling. I can see his face is bleeding onto the collar of his white uniform. The man who entered says something scathing in another language, and the soldier leaves without looking at me once.</p>\n\n<p>I cough. &quot;Who are you?&quot; My voice croaks. I spit crimson blood onto the polished, spotless grey floor. As my eyes regain full focus, I can make out this man is a high officer. A knight of the Imperial Royal Navy. He is not in command of this ship, but rather an envoy of a higher authority. He must be here on a mission sanctioned by the highest order. Maybe even the Emperor himself.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Knight Commander Ayers,&quot; he says, his expression strangely blank. I can tell he has no interest in my interrogation. Ayers pauses and looks at the table, the folder, the soldier&#39;s blood, and red spit on the polished floor. &quot;And that was my officer you assaulted.&quot; He speaks perfect Athylian, with authority, and has no accent. &quot;And the King&#39;s ship you spat on.&quot; He says, pointing at the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Commander Ayers is an older, hardened man. His face is sharp and his eyes cold, and his hair is tidy and clipped. He wears his uniform with discipline and respect.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at Ayers, &quot;He deserved it.&quot; I said. I view my blood, lying in a small puddle on deck. &quot;Apologies for the mess.&quot; I say to the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Ayers ignores my statement, and does not respond, instead he turns to the table, picks up the folder, and leafs through its contents. After a few moments, he looks up at me. &quot;Ms. Amal, as you are well aware</p>\n\n<p>He closes the folder on the table and takes a seat opposite me. Ayers is middle-aged, and tall with a dark complexion. His dark skin contrasts with his stark white uniform. Like all Knights he&#39;s wearing his white and scarlet uniform. His epaulets, shoulderboards, and shoulder-cuff rank insignia all say the same, &quot;I&#39;m a sword for the King.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hear me, Captain,&quot; Ayers spoke with a commanding tone. &quot;I shall not mince words. The recent atrocities at Port Charity and beyond have reached my ears. Innocents have fallen, their blood spilled by those who seek nothing but destruction. My eyes have been upon you for some time now.&quot; He pauses, and then continues. &quot;Resnick, who styles himself as a leader among the more radical factions, is of great concern to the King.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t work for him — or anyone else for that matter.&quot; It hurts my jaw to speak. &quot;I know nothing of the colonies. The war ended before I was even born.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You may not be familiar with them, or of the war, but they are aware of you, Captain.&quot; He continues, tapping his finger on the table. &quot;I&#39;ve read your dossier, and it seems you have a knack for making friends in high places. It would be unwise to underestimate you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why am I here?&quot; I ask, tired of his games.</p>\n\n<p>Ayers looks at me, his face betraying no emotion. &quot;In my possession, I hold two letters, both bearing the signature of his Majesty, the King of Perseus.&quot; He reaches into the inner pocket of his coat, pulling out two red envelopes. The letters are sealed with a golden wax seal, bearing the mark of the Athylian Empire. &quot;One letter grants you freedom, for your valiant efforts in the service of the crown. The other, however, secures your cell in the prison ship <em>Hildersham Castle</em>, for the rest of your natural life. They are both signed by the King.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ayers sets a letter on the table in front of me. I don&#39;t move. &quot;I&#39;m good at my job, Commander.&quot; I say. I look at him, and then the letters.</p>\n\n<p>Mouth throbbing, head aching, tied to a chair in the middle of an Imperial warship while sitting across from an Imperial Knight. &quot;So you wish for me to find this Resnick? And when you are finished, what then? What assurance do I have? How can I trust you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not here to make you trust me, Captain.&quot; Ayers responds. &quot;I&#39;ve been sent to eliminate a problem. You, Resnick, and this mission will all be used in the service of the King&#39;s will.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nod, in understanding.</p>\n\n<p>He stands and walks to the door as two imperial guards enter. One stays in the front of the room and places his hand on his sidearm. He does not draw his weapon. The other comes behind me; she crouches down and unbinds my hands. With my arms free, I stretch and shake them out. They&#39;re sore, like the rest of my body.</p>\n\n<p>He pulls out an old model pistol from his holster. I notice the colored, worn wood-lain grip of <em>Reason to Believe</em>. He hands it to me grip first. My instinct is to put two rounds in his chest. Granted, a bad idea in the middle of a Kingship. I take it from his hand, turning it over, making sure it&#39;s in one piece. Opening the breach reveals an empty firing chamber, I look at Ayers. He nods, and I holster my weapon under my coat.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I would not offer a loaded weapon to a woman like you.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I would not offer that weapon to anyone.&quot; I respond, knowing what <em>Reason to Believe</em> is capable of.</p>\n\n<p>He nods, but he has no idea. &quot;Your enemies are right in fearing you.&quot; He continues, &quot;You could be a powerful ally to Athylia, and to the King if you choose so.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>His sentiment has little effect. &quot;Are we through here?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We are.&quot; Ayers declares, gesturing with his hand. &quot;Bring Resnick here, unharmed, within the next six cycles, and your destiny shall be in your own hands. Fail to do so, and I assure you, Captain, our paths shall cross again.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He shows me the door. I rub my aching jaw and walk out. Two armed guards meet me outside the room, one says, &quot;This way.&quot; I notice a familiar chevron and falcon design on one of the guards as we walk. Are they the same two men I passed in Breehl? We exit the airlock, and they leave me at the wide dock-way. A Tu couple passes by, bundled up, they both stare at my swollen, bloody face. The female utters something in Tuvian to her partner. They quicken their pace down the dock-way, looking back at me before exiting.</p>\n\n<p>I know what I look like.</p>\n\n<p>Walking back to <em>Opportune</em>, the cold air feels good on my throbbing bruises. I enter docking bay four and see her as I left her. Each press of a button on the access panel emits a beep, and moments later, I&#39;m inside my ship, rummaging through the galley for cold water, cloth, and a stiff drink.</p>\n\n<p>I swallow a mouthful of water, washing away a small amount of blood from a cut inside my lip. It&#39;s difficult to close my mouth without it hurting. I study my swollen face in the mirror. Sweeping my tousled hair back reveals a gash on my swollen cheekbone. The cloth, cold and wet, feels good against the swelling.</p>\n\n<p>In the mirror, I see the face of a woman who&#39;s been through hell. A face that&#39;s seen death, betrayal, and heartache. A face that&#39;s not afraid to fight. That face looks back at me, saying, &quot;Resnick.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>12</h1>\n\n<p>Before the first galactic explorers dove into the depths of the great void, Athylian cosmologists calculated the number of and planets, stars, and moons in their galaxy to be in the order of thousands of billions. A few million were reachable with their early faster-than-light technology. They surmised that given the millions of reachable systems, there would be numerous worlds suitable for the salvation of the Athylian people. The people estimated thousands of planets with nitrogen-rich atmospheres, with liquid water and tepid gravity.</p>\n\n<p>They were dead wrong. The pioneers discovered breathable planets with suitable gravity are rare in the galaxy, planets with abundant natural life and resources even more so. Their little moon was unique, and given the enormity of the galaxy they were relatively alone. Seven of these high-habitability worlds, or <em>primes</em> were chosen, and subsequently colonized by the Kingdom of Athylia many hundreds of lya ago.</p>\n\n<p>On these new worlds, Athylian settlers were rarely greeted with open arms. An early group of settlers in the in the Ogma Colony wrote a journal entry:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although our many attempts at communicating have failed, the people of this world have been able to make one thing clear. We are not wanted. This is not our world for the taking. I&#39;ve sent word to our King that we should leave at once. I fear there will be none of us left when our relief arrives. We lost two more of ours to ills unknown today. The natives are spiteful things. Surely they have some venom in their blood. I suspect it is why they are so quick to anger.<br/><br/>- Rector B., Ogma Colony</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By the time the relief arrived, all the original 150 settlers except for Rector had perished. The native people of Ogma left him alive to tell his story. To serve as a warning. Athylia ignored him. Ogma was eventually taken by force. The natives were never seen again. Their voices and languages never recorded. A loss as greater than the loss of the settlers themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Ogma, the other six colonies, along with smaller outposts, moons, and relay stations, comprise the Athylian Empire as it stands today. The empire reigns over three galactic regions, Athylia, Perseus, and Onania, each with their monarch who is given provincial sovereignty by the crown and limited power under the auspice of the Emperor. Five of the seven colonies lay in the Athylia region, that being the closest to the metropole, New Athylia. While the Perseus and Onania regions have a single settlement on each of their prime worlds.</p>\n\n<p>There are subregions of Onania and Perseus that fall outside the sovereignty of the crown. One prominent region is a thriving mercantile republic in distant Onania known as Drenthe. The Athylian Empire and the Drenthe Republic share a long history. A story marked with ages of peace and times of war. The monarch, threatened by the ideals of representative government, fears the dilution of their power if their people turn to democracy. Thus, the empire is unkind towards republics. It is even less kind toward revolutionaries from within its borders.</p>\n\n<p>The Drenthe hold a distinct trading advantage over the mighty empire. The imperial edge of their territory contains broad bands of a scoret and cobhire. The Scoret Coast, as it&#39;s known, is an often disputed bit of dust and space where work is plentiful, lawless, and often dangerous. There, prospectors hope to capture the precious metals that are essential for coinage and jewelry. The Scoret Coast, along with the size and economic skill of the republic, makes it a vital power in the galactic trade market.</p>\n\n<p>Cobhire, or &quot;cob&quot; as it&#39;s known to the locals, is a rare and precious metal. And a potential source of conflict on the galactic stage. There is no substitute for cob. It is the only material that can effectively withstand the strain and heat of a starship&#39;s engine. The Athylians are heavily dependent on cob to fuel their military, and thus the Athylian Empire. They are well aware that the Drenthe Republic controls the majority of the cob supply. As such, The Republic stands as an arms-length ally to the empire. A young Drenthe took a neutral position and stayed out of the War of the Seven Colonies. They&#39;ve opted instead to focus on growing their territory deeper into uncharted depths of space.</p>\n\n<p>Ogma was the second colony established in the Athylia region, the oldest before Kelesia. Like its six sister colonies, it&#39;s a rich and vibrant world. Naturally diverse with liquid water oceans and breathable air, a world dissimilar to the icy home of the empire, New Athylia. The first settlers arrived on Ogma about 75 lya ago, and many waves followed after that initial landing. Colonists eventually founded a handful of coastal settlements along with one lunar colony, Tau Ogma. There, on the second moon of Ogma, amidst the pale regolith and a growing labyrinth of Helion mines, I was born.</p>\n\n<p>The mines of my childhood were dirty, hectic places, Crowded with exhausted men and women in bulky suits soiled with gray lunar dust. Workers were paid by the load to dig and haul regolith or to pack and unpack the gas extractors. It was arduous work and the miners had little to show for it. A stagnate economy kept them poor and under the yoke of the aristocracy. The few that could scrape up enough money would board a shuttle to one of the other prime worlds, or the metropole itself, for a better life.</p>\n\n<p>Life on Tau Ogma was a simple one. It resembled a frontier town just after its founding only grown larger and more crowded. There was a small city of workers, their families and their friends. There was a small contingent of military men and women. Mechanics and engineers. And one man who served as magistrate, but was rarely seen.</p>\n\n<p>As the city grew, so did the population. It was then that I was born into a family of miners, owners of a small home and a pair of ore-stripping machines. My mother, Leda, and father, Serein, were never rich. They were not poor. They lived a life that was above the standard for the working class. My mother was a skilled mechanic and my father, a talented miner. They worked hard and never complained. They built a life and a home for me and my brother, Odain, to grow up in.</p>\n\n<p>I can remember my early years on Tau Ogma in a series of vignettes. I remember my father&#39;s calloused hands, work worn and tough. I remember my mother&#39;s bright smile, and the scent of her hair. A dense, chocolate brown, so unlike my father&#39;s pale blond. I remember the warmth of her hugs and the strength of her voice. It was only years later that I realized how unique she was to the people of Tau Ogma. At the time, she was just my mother. The woman I could go to whenever I was hurt. The woman who would make me feel better with a simple touch.</p>\n\n<p>My mother&#39;s story was one of resilience and determination. She was a survivor, a fighter. Her eyes held a fierce determination that never wavered, even in the face of adversity. She had been discovered on a derelict freighter by an imperial cruiser on routine patrol. The ship was a decoy, part of a scheme to capture a powerful imperial cruiser by an audacious outer territory gang called the Arawa. The bait of the decoy freighter was those who put up a fight against them or those with unpaid debts. The group included my pregnant mother, as well as myself, her unborn child. The Arawa intended to sell me off when I was born. My mother had other plans.</p>\n\n<p>I have no idea how long she was aboard the nightmare of a ship — trapped with little food and water, running on auxiliary power, and waiting in the dark for an unsuspecting imperial patrol to find them. Once the empire discovered the distress signal, they docked with the derelict craft and sent a rescue team aboard. They opened the airlock and were met with darkness, stale air, and a dying group of fifty men and women. They began the rescue operation immediately, starting with the most urgent of the survivors. My pregnant and ailing mother was lucky to be one of the first off. The Arawa commenced the surprise attack moments after the first group of survivors were safe aboard the imperial cruiser.</p>\n\n<p>The battle lasted only long enough for the Arawa to realize they were outnumbered and outgunned. Nine women, two men, and one unborn child were saved. The empire lost six sailors, and one imperial officer of whom I&#39;m named after. For that, my mother always held a special place in her heart for Athylia, and the imperium. By the time I was born, her life on the outer territories was a distant memory, but her story was not forgotten. I was born an imperial citizen, but the frontier would always be in my blood.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I take a step back from the mirror and my eyes catch sight of the dark red droplets that have dried on my shirt. I run my finger over one, unsure if it&#39;s my own blood or that of the quartermaster&#39;s. I quickly strip off the stained shirt and pull on a fresh, dark one before making my way to the bridge of the Opportune. The only sound is the low chatter of the landing frequency coming through the headset on the central console. I check the fuel levels on the propulsion panel and a sense of relief washes over me as I see that the ship has been fully refueled during my absence.</p>\n\n<p>If Malik is right, and Resnick is a freedom fighter, someone in the colonies must know about him or his whereabouts. I can&#39;t go back to Malik. He thinks I&#39;ve left the port. Turning to him would do nothing but raise suspicions. If only I could find the woman from before—the one I met on Bowenn. My memory becomes the image of the flag flown by the ragtag crew on Bowenn. Blue and white, with an animal, and a cluster of stars—three stars. I see it in my mind&#39;s eye amid the desert landscape.</p>\n\n<p>I move toward the navigator&#39;s station and flick on a light attached to the bulkhead. The lamp emits a warm yellow glow, filling the corner of the bridge. Along the wall is a low, sectioned container holding a dozen or so rolled navigation charts. Atop the table lay navigation instruments, the <em>Stellar Navigation and Astrometry Ephemeris</em>, and a parallel rule. I slide a well worn sectional chart out of its tubular slot and roll it out on the table. The legend reads <em>Cerulean Belt, Athylia Section</em>. It&#39;s made of a beautiful paper woven with cloth fibers and lays flat like an elegant tablecloth. My hands smooth the linen-textured chart on the table.</p>\n\n<p>Their charts are truly works of art, with each one telling a unique story. The lines are crisp and precise, and the lettering is flawless. But it&#39;s the small details that truly set these charts apart from others. The threads of woven scoret that adorn the edges, the subtle shading that gives depth and dimension to the stars, and the intricate symbols that mark the locations of planets and nebulae. These charts are not just a tool for navigation, but a window into the wonders of the galaxy.</p>\n\n<p>Each cartographer takes great pride in their work and sign their charts. They are a symbol of their mastery, and a testament to the cartographer&#39;s dedication to their craft. They are treasured by navigators, who rely on them to guide them through the vast expanse of the galaxy. They are a symbol of the eternal desire to explore and discover.</p>\n\n<p>These charts are essential to interstellar navigation. Each star system has its orbit about the galactic center along with its galactic plane inclination, and celestial coordinates. Each star&#39;s galactic coreward longitude presented is relative to the galactic center, and each star&#39;s spinward latitude as the angular distance perpendicular to the galactic equator. </p>\n\n<p>Given an inclination, coreward, and spinward coordinates, you can get <em>anywhere</em>. This particular chart is a mere sliver of the galaxy, a small section I know well called the Cerulean Belt, part of the known Galaxy of Cerulea.</p>\n\n<p>Most navigators follow established trade routes. They are well-vetted, safe, and efficient. Roads like the heavily trafficked Trans Perseus, Athylian Rim, and Kings March are frequently patrolled by the empire to protect the interests of the crown. Avoiding these tracks, and the empire requires intimate knowledge of the invisible paths connecting the stars. A route overheard in a bar after a barge captain downed one too many drinks. A family secret passed on through the generations, or something scribbled on the back of a worn-out chart. These are the routes that kiss the edges of the known galaxy. Pirates frequent these frontier passages and while being ignored by the law. These routes are my routes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Three stars,&quot; I whisper aloud, scanning the chart with my finger. I imagine, it <em>could</em> mean they&#39;re from a trinary system, consisting of three stars orbiting around their common barycenter. They&#39;re common in the belt — my mind races. I scour my knowledge of the Cruelan belt for these specific star clusters.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let me see...&quot; I take a breath. Next to each star system on the chart is a small white symbol indicating the number of stars in the system. I pass over stars not matching my mind&#39;s query and tap my finger on a trinary system called Kelesia, the Athylian word for Coyote.</p>\n\n<p>Of course. The animal depicted on the banner must have been a Kelesia. The namesake of the oldest and most well-known colonies.</p>\n\n<p>I stand, look around the table a bit, and grab the Stellar Almanac. I plot a hurried course from my current location in the Orylia system to Kelesia Prime. After flipping through the &quot;KE&quot; section of the astrometry tables, I work out a small amount of math with a dark blue pencil on some scrap paper. I trace a path across the chart using my parallel rule. The route will take <em>Opportune</em> out of the Perseus region through the Ashby Nebula. We will traverse the coreward side of the Iron Cluster, and into the imperial area of Athylia, ending up at Kings Crossing in the Kelesia system.</p>\n\n<p>I sit in the worn helm seat, feeling the familiar curves and grooves molded to my body. I power up <em>Opportune</em> and the old engines come to life, groaning and rumbling like an aged beast waking for a long hunt. The bridge is filled with a dim green light from the instruments, and the soft glow of the window overlooking the landing bay. I begin the startup sequence and monitoring the instruments, the familiar sounds and sights of my ship a comforting presence in the vast silence.</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> lifts off and blows more dust and debris off the hanger deck and into space. I rotate and guide her out of the landing bay. The moment <em>Opportune</em> crosses the threshold of the doors, I give her more power, banking to the left, the dark side of Orylia fills my view and obstructs the distant starfield. I pass the backside of the station and discover the docked corvette. Alongside her is <em>Blackmore Ketch</em>. Looking forward, I increase the throttle and fling into a high orbit around the planet.</p>\n\n<p>My gypsy class freighter, and I cross into a twin sunrise. We power ahead with speed and grace. Orylian double sunlight drenches the bridge, and make a single revolution around Orylia. Before coming around to Port Bethany once more, I bolster her engines. At full power, we break away from our orbit, sailing at full speed away from the planet below. The kinetic momentum, combined with the thrust of the engines, slingshots <em>Opportune</em> back towards the waypoint where we can safely endter to faster-than-light travel without getting caught in the gravity of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Minutes later, my ship and I reach the lonely radio buoy marking the waypoint, bobbing in space, with the shape of a drawn-out metal pill. It has two slender antennas protruding from the top and bottom of its small chassis. Green lights on the tips of the antennas blink with a slow alternating rhythm. Painted in white on both sides of the buoy is the number twelve, along with a cluster Perseid script below.</p>\n\n<p>With a gentle touch, I guide Opportune to a full stop, the engines falling silent. I turn my gaze towards the distant planet, its blue crescent edge beckoning me forward. The stellar sextant attached to the forward bridge window catches my eye, and with a sturdy click, I extend it out, aligning its offsets with the notches in its frame.</p>\n\n<p>My fingers wrap around the stick by my waist, and I control the position thrusters with precision, guiding <em>Opportune</em> towards the horizon of the planet. With each puff of white gas, the ship moves closer, the crosshairs of the sextant aligning directly with the edge of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Breathing deeply, I lean back and read the numbers off the chart on the navigator&#39;s table. The awkward position is worth it, as I commit the calculations to memory. With a steady hand, I offset the sextant, taking care to ensure its accuracy. The crosshairs now point directly at my destination, the dim star Kelesia, hidden amidst a patch of black space. <em>Opportune</em> is now aimed and ready to take me there.</p>\n\n<p>In an instant, <em>Opportune</em> accelerates far beyond the speed of light, disappearing into the murky void between space and time.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The galley is a cramped metal closet branching off of the central passageway opposite of the living quarters. Through the narrow hatch, lights automatically flick on as I enter. A worn metal counter leads to the storage area in the back. The counter has a basin, and two electric warmers, as well as a bit of cloth wrapped bread I haven&#39;t finished. From the overhead cabinet, I fetch an unmarked metal cylinder. Removing the lid, my nostrils fill with the aroma of Loreos tea. I bring a pot to boil and steep the tea leaves into the hot water. I place the teapot in the warmers and the two cups beside them.</p>\n\n<p>I drag myself to the galley table and sit down, collapsing with relief into the hard seat.</p>\n\n<p>The warmers come on with a gentle hum, and steam rises from the teapot. The burly scent draws me out of my thoughts as I pour the still-steaming tea into my cup and take a slow sip. The tea is strong and bitter, but it warms my weary body and soul. I close my eyes and let out a weary breath. The tea helps me to think more clearly.</p>\n\n<p>After a few minutes, I think through my situation. The woman who works for Resnick and her intentions. The colonies and the idea of another war. Kelesia and what I might find there.</p>\n\n<p>I rise and turn to the storage cabinet, my fingers rummage through the contents within. There are plenty of canned goods, but it&#39;s the arza bread I&#39;m after. I grab a small dark loaf and return to the table. The cloth-wrapped slab has a pungent smell that can be intimidating, but the taste is delicious. The bread has a sharp, almost acidic bite and a deep crust, covered in seeds. Arza bread is a star sailors&#39; staple, able to endure long voyages without spoiling.</p>\n\n<p>I slice a small piece off, and place it into my mouth. The bread has a satisfying texture, with a warm, nutty flavor. I take another piece and this time dump some butter on top. The salty, creamy spread is a welcome addition to the bread. I take another sip of tea and stare out at the distant stars.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time in a while, I feel at peace. But I know that this peace will not last. Malik. Resnick. Ayers. I can&#39;t help but feel that I&#39;m getting played by powers beyond my control. But I have to press forward with heart and mind, for I know that just beyond the horizon, there is a new horizon waiting for me.</p>\n\n<h1>13</h1>\n\n<p>I jolt awake as the blaring alarm of the FTL panel pierces through my groggy state. My mouth feels like sandpaper as I force it open, my eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden light. As my vision clears, I see that we have successfully navigated through the dense nebula and are now well past the treacherous Iron Cluster.</p>\n\n<p>With the SL drive on the verge of shutting down, I slowly stretch my arms and neck, feeling the tightness from hours of sitting still. My movements are sluggish and uncoordinated as I fumble with the buckles of my harness, my brain still trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. Eventually, I manage to secure myself in, feeling a sense of relief wash over me.</p>\n\n<p>I take hold of the thrust controls, steadying the ship as the relativistic waves grow stronger. My eyes drift over to my cold cup of tea sitting on the console, the porcelain rattling and fluttering with each jolt of turbulence. I reach for it, but a sudden jolt shakes the entire craft, causing me to rethink my decision. It&#39;s best to focus on flying the ship, I think to myself, leaving the tea untouched.</p>\n\n<p>A terrific flash fills the bridge, and we arrive in the Kelesia system. I take a moment to recalibrate to the calmness and stillness of subluminal space flight. Remembering the charts, it should be a straight shot into Kelesia Prime from the crossing. </p>\n\n<p>Ahead, orbiting the planet at a distance four times any moon is an immense structure made of dark grey metal, a superluminal transfer gate known as Kelesia Crossing. The portal is owned and operated by the Athylian Empire. Its terminus lay hundreds of lightlya from here, near the Imperial homeworld of Athylia.</p>\n\n<p>Kelesia Crossing, and other gates like it, are used to launch smaller ships with underpowered superluminal drives to a fixed point on the other side of the region. They can also be used to launch larger vessels that may have older, or limited-distance drives, further they can travel under their own power. Once launched by the gate, a passage to the other side could take up to an entire week for some of the larger ships.</p>\n\n<p>A variety of aging ships lay scattered in the space surrounding the circular gate structure. Some flying imperial colors, all are awaiting their turn to enter. The empire operates the gates giving priority to their interests. Some captains have waited months if not longer, to obtain their jump slip. The mismanagement of these gates has made those who can make the journey without the help of the empire, essential.</p>\n\n<p>As my ship and I approach, a lumbering old bulk carrier reaches the gate aperture. She shuts down her engines to prepare for the launch. Darkness cloaks her three aft rocket bells. The aged craft is leaking coolant or atmosphere because she&#39;s enveloped in a light white mist. Her lateral position lights strobe every few seconds, illuminating the particle cloud for an instant. It&#39;s the strobing light allows me to read the faded name on her hull <em>KS Loyal Explorer</em>. Small white harbor craft dance around the barge carrier, ignoring the leaking fog. They&#39;ve attached cables to her frame, and are tugging her into launch position. The harbor craft each have small yellow lights, like fireflies, swarming and flashing out of sync. After aligning the barge&#39;s nose with the gate, the harbor tugs retreat to a safe waiting position.</p>\n\n<p>The massive aperture blades of the Kelesia Crossing gate adjust to the size of the barge, rotating as they travel inward. Once the aperture reaches its final position, the gateway starts its power-up sequence. A faint white light to shines from the center of the opening. Growing brighter and brighter, it illuminates the entire bow of <em>Loyal Explorer</em>. The mist she was leaking is sucked into the gate as if swirling down the drain of a basin. She lights her three main engines and rumbles into the portal under her power. The light grows, white rays beam from the depths of the gate, consuming the bow of the ship. She picks up a little speed, slipping lower into the portal until she is swallowed whole by the light. She&#39;s gone. The gate stays lit stays for a moment. In an instant, it all goes dark. The aperture blades turn and reset to the most extended position and the fireflies jump into action, preparing for the next launch.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, <em>Opportune</em> has an internal faster-than-light system. It&#39;s not the newest, or most reliable, but it means I&#39;m not waiting for clearance or having the empire in my cargo hold asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>They <em>love</em> asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>I fly past the gate at full speed, sailing past the group of awaiting ships. Each ship is of various size and shape. Each is taking an interlude in their stories while waiting for their turn to continue. From their vantage point, they see my ship, and I am leaving a faint trail of glowing ions in our wake. I reach a high orbital distance of the planet Kelesia. An imperial patrol group passes me, heading to the crossing. Their imposing presence reminds me that Kelesia is the largest, oldest, and most valuable imperial colony in the galaxy.</p>\n\n<p>The patrol group consists of a battleship, heavy cruiser, and a small fighter squadron. They are primarily there to enforce order and collect fees. The group sails through the upper atmosphere, quite distant off my bow. The battleship flanked by the two smaller vessels is easily the most intimidating. With the side angle, they look more like anvils than warships. All are painted stark white with the same chevron design. The design is meant to convey discipline, order, and service to the empire.</p>\n\n<p>I should be more worried about them, but for some reason my conversation with Ayers makes me feel like they&#39;re more likely to leave me alone. If they wanted to inspect me, they would have ordered a deviation. I continue on my way, hugging a twisted, circular orbit on the far side of the planet. </p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> cuts into a lower orbit, and we slow enough to make a powered descent into the cool stratosphere. The deorbit is not loud or fiery, but instead, it&#39;s deliberate and slow. As the oxygen catches in the glow-stream, <em>Opportune</em> passes over the planet, red-purple auroras flare to life. The storm clouds above reflect the fierce light from the upper atmosphere. </p>\n\n<p>My ship is unlike transport ships that can re-enter using the atmosphere as a friction brake, saving fuel and burning off energy. <em>Opportune</em> has no heat shield, forcing her to make wasteful power-on de-orbits.</p>\n\n<p>As we glide through the thick, nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere of Kelesia Prime, the aerodynamics of our ship take over. The controls feel heavy in my hands as we battle the buffeting and friction caused by the dense air. As we approach the surface, the view below takes my breath away. Rolling hills of verdant forest blanket the landscape, dotted with small wooden towers poking above the treeline. A glistening lake sparkles in the center, surrounded by snow-capped mountains that seem to reach for the sky. It&#39;s easy to see why the empire deemed this world so important to colonize - its natural beauty is undeniable. The western hemisphere remains largely untouched, but the eastern hemisphere teems with life, the most populous being the colonial city of Carit, nestled in the heart of the mountain country, 900 km east.</p>\n\n<p>The large mountain chain below sprawls through the southern part of the continent. There, a few thousand kilometers from the equator, the gentle land slopes and flattens into a vast basin. Rivers that hold their source in the high mountains drain into the basin and onward into the southern oceans. At the mouth of these rivers lay vast areas of swamp and marshland — thousands of years of sediment deposits, combined with semi-tropical temperatures created this lush, but uninhabited region. Tales of an ancient, ruined civilization in the swamps are many and varied. But, as with most things, the truth has been lost to myth and legend.</p>\n\n<p>When close enough, I acquire the signal for the directional beacon of the city. I make a broad turn towards it, pitching down to burn off altitude while relying on the drag of my ship to slow down even further. The approach is gorgeous. Lush valleys pass below with the three suns reflecting off the stark blue lakes. In the distance, I spot the low, grey, and white buildings of Carit. Long ago it was a settlement with only a handful of brave pioneers. Now it&#39;s a large, populous city, intent on pushing back the frontier clawing at its doorstep.</p>\n\n<p>Kelesia Prime was the first planet colonized by the empire. It&#39;s been long since the early settlers arrived, and now many new towns have emerged. Today the planet is home to a thriving native-born population. A population that has since established vital industries such as mining, shipbuilding, fishing, and canning. Although the territory has almost everything it needs to be an independent state, it remains a significant part of the imperial interests.</p>\n\n<p>Carit was the confederate capital and the largest city during the War of the Seven Colonies. Athylia desperately wanted to keep as much of the colonial cities standing as possible. Not long after war broke out, the empire initiated a fierce ground campaign to quell the rebellion while minimizing damage to valuable infrastructure. The Kelesians fought hard. They were skilled outdoorsmen and even better marksmen. Imperial soldiers were not familiar with the rough forested terrain. Their leaders, who excelled at naval warfare, lacked terrestrial fighting experience. To that end, the Athylian empire had entered a lengthy ground war with the confederacy they could not win. Not without directing resources away from the coordinated uprisings in other six colonies.</p>\n\n<p>Three lya into the campaign, the warm season drew to a close. While another harsh winter loomed in the mountain regions, the imperial military strategists projected they would suffer more losses on all the Kelesian fronts. After bitter fighting and the recent loss at the mountain city of Kethar, the King sent imperial delegates to negotiate with the Kelesian confederacy. With a seething crowd outside the consulate building, imperial ambassadors made a last plea. Comply with Athylia, pledge allegiance to the empire, and nullify their new constitution. The empire made it clear they were willing to raze the city to end the fighting, as well as to send a message to the six other colonies. Upon leaving the Carit parliament hall, the two ambassadors were mobbed and killed—beaten to death. The fate of many settlers and natively born confederates were sealed that day.</p>\n\n<p>The orbital bombardment commenced the night after imperial leaders withdrew their ground forces. The Confederate troops on Kelesia were delighted by the sudden retreat. They celebrated it as a victory—until night fell and the first shells rained on Carit. For ten cycles, night after night, imperial ships bombarded the planet with their heavy guns. Ten cycles of decimating any valuable target, power stations, shipyards, barracks, the homes of rebel generals and their families. Ten cycles of terror and death raining from the sky each night. The surrender came on the eleventh morning, by way of a Confederate transport shuttle carrying General Lorel Forge. She arrived aboard the King&#39;s Ship <em>KS Resolute</em> to formally surrender. </p>\n\n<p>The native-born general&#39;s actions ended The War of the Seven Colonies after many seasons of conflict. Post-surrender, the empire occupied the capital. They garrisoned troops in schools, churches, and private homes. Royal officers replaced positions in the local government and established new regulations. For lya to follow, the imperial grip over the colonies would be tighter than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>The empire drafted the <em>Colonial Peace and Security Act</em> in lya 1809 Aldeos as a way to limit the independence of the colonies. Many saw it for what it was: punishment for the attempted revolution. It revised the original charters of the colonies by reinforcing the absolute rule of the king, now emperor. The act disallowed the free election of a legislative assembly in the colonies. Instead, it placed direct representatives of the empire, known as arbiters, to head legal matters. The universally hated arbiters only recently left the territories, a sign of renewed trust in the colonial government. </p>\n\n<p>Today the empire encourages settlers to come to the colonies. They provide supplies, livestock, and new housing for anyone willing to leave outer rim territories. Collectively named &quot;The Athylian Colonization Program&quot;, this initiative has greatly increased the population in the colonies and Kelisia. It also serves to dry up the rest of the independent territories, and helps create loyal citizens. </p>\n\n<p>Many argue that the program was an attempt to make the colonies more profitable, and it was. But, many also credit the program for easing long-time tensions between the colonies and the homeworld. It also brought over prominent experts, machinery, and much needed infrastructure. Regardless of the motivations, the provinces are better off than they were before—even if not everyone was given a fair share of the wealth.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s been an increasing number of citizens in the colonies who no longer see themselves as imperial citizens. Young natives born after the war receive only a sliver of pre-colonial Kelesian history. The rest they learn in school, from thin booklets full of propaganda: <em>The Athylian Peacekeeping Army</em> - <em>The Onanian Non Aggression Pact</em> - <em>The Great Resettlement</em>. The average Kelesian kid doesn&#39;t even know why the Athylians were at war with their ancestors, and they question why the empire stuck around after the war. Many young people are highly critical of the empire, especially those in the coastal settlements. Random acts of defiance and violence have been increasing in the past ten lya. The leaders sighting civil rights issues, inequality, and harsh imperial policies as justification. </p>\n\n<p>The Kelesian government has taken a hard-line stance against what they call &quot;Kelesian Separatists&quot;. They are punishing known or suspected campaigners by force, rather than justice. The most recent legislation proposes an extension certain clauses in colonial charters, and the removal of additional rights for most Kelesian citizens. This is done under the pretense of fighting separatism. In reality, it is a way for the empire to keep a firm grasp on their colonies, and to prevent any future uprisings. </p>\n\n<p>The local Kelesian government has been cracking down hard on separatists throughout the territories. The Arbiters have been granted police powers, making them a legal law enforcement body of the Kelesian territories. Kelesian border forces are also encouraged to make arrests and exercise violence against Separatists, particularly in the more remote areas of the Colonies. </p>\n\n<p>There is no reliable information on the insurgent strength or capabilities. However, I’ve heard news of Kelesian Separatists having ready access to Athylian military equipment. Even some of the more sophisticated ordinance such as flak disruptors. It&#39;s a timely reminder that there are grievances in the provinces that don&#39;t exist in the empire. The old wounds are still fresh - the fire is ready. All it takes is spark.</p>\n\n<p>Flying closer, I break through a low wispy cloud layer and sail above the city. I try to discern any scars from a war that happened before I was born: craters, damaged buildings—the burned-out hull of an imperial cruiser. There&#39;s nothing. At least nothing I can see from here. It&#39;s as if it never happened. A war left only to exist in the hearts and minds of those who lived through it.</p>\n\n<p>After contacting the dockmaster, I receive a prompt clearance to land. The main starport of Carit is near the central district of the city. An anchorage for long-haul vessels coming from the empire, it&#39;s one of the busiest ports on Kelisia. The only other port of note is in the settlement of Kethar, a two-day journey by land. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m assigned to a square pad near a small structure with a large antenna atop its low, flat roof. <em>Opportune</em> blows the cement pad clear of dust and sets down. No gravity transfer needed. We land adjacent to an old model clipper. Across the way is a modern, midsize freighter, her crew unloading containers from her hold, and loading them onto small wheeled carts. I put on my coat, check my sidearm, and head into the wilds of the starport.</p>\n\n<p>Carit is an old city with a young heart. After the war came and went, those who remained chose nothing but to rebuild. After years of hard labor, the city rose once again like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Between the war, the unforgiving wilderness and the harsh winters, Kelesians are survivors through and through—hearty and full of spirit and vigor.</p>\n\n<p>The city lies in a valley, bound by a mountain range, on the shores of a deep freshwater lake. The nearby forests provide an abundance of woodland resources. Homes in the city are made of the harvest of these boreal fields of piney green. During the war, people fled to those forests to evade the invading forces. The Kelesians banded together and formed tight communities in the high woodlands. Unified by their fear of an imperial occupied Carit.</p>\n\n<p>A mix of old and new, the city&#39;s central district is home to grand, ornate buildings that date back to pre-colonial times. They are adorned with intricate carvings and adorned with ancient symbols. They are a testament to the rich history and culture of Kelisia. But, as you move further out, you&#39;ll find modern buildings and infrastructure, built after the war. They are a symbol of the city&#39;s determination to move forward.</p>\n\n<p>As I close the rear cargo door of my craft, I can&#39;t help but take in the sights and sounds of the bustling starport. The activity is almost overwhelming, as passengers rush past me with luggage in tow and various beings unload and load vessels. The chaos is overwhelming, but it&#39;s also a sign of the city&#39;s resilience and determination to move forward.</p>\n\n<p>But as I look around, I notice something unexpected. The imperial presence is surprisingly minimal. Sure, there are a few imperial police milling around under the far end of an old star clipper, but they seem relaxed and casual, not on high alert as I would expect given recent attacks. One guard is even smoking and they&#39;re not paying much attention to anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>This all changes as the local harbormaster makes his way through the busy port. Cutting through the crowded main walkway, he approaches my ship, his clipboard and its attached stack of landing slips waving in his arm. He assesses my ship, no doubt calculating the tariff he&#39;s about to collect. He&#39;s an older man, with a hunched back and an old-style imperial hat. His presence is a reminder of the ever-present imperial influence on Kelisia.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Name?&quot; he barks. The harbormaster is all business. I&#39;m not surprised. The harbormaster is one of the few Kelesians that have had direct, up-close contact with the empire. The harbormaster is a career bureaucrat—a functionary, if you will.</p>\n\n<p>I offer something of a smile. &quot;Caius.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The harbormaster squints at my ship&#39;s hull. He looks at me again, his eyes narrow and his head cocked to the side, obviously unsatisfied with my answer.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Business?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Trade and barter. I&#39;m in need of supplies.&quot; I announce, examining him and a new craft that is unloading across the way behind him.</p>\n\n<p>With the stump of a blunt pencil, he begins scratching his clipboard. Without looking up, he continues, &quot;How long?&quot; He inquires. His shorthand makes a circular motion as if he&#39;s already waited too long for me to answer.</p>\n\n<p>The impatient man is a Bogmire. His yellowish skin is dark and spotted with delicate flecks of cream and tan. His eyes are wide, dull, and glassy. This figure reminds of a creature I knew long ago. A miserly businessperson that found it in himself to offer me my first job. A miserable creature named Greem who ran a salvage operation on the outskirts of the Scoret Coast.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Two. Three cycles if trading is—&quot; I respond, but my words are cut off from the sound of his stamp upon the landing chit. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Three marks fifty.&quot; He tells me the cost of landing fee, excluding fuel.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not cheap. I pay him from the black coin purse Malik gave me. Removing four heavy coins from the satchel, I hand them to the imperial harbormaster.</p>\n\n<p>He drops the coins into his pocket and rips the top square of paper from his stack. The yellow chit is small and stiff between his scabby yellow fingers. He hands it to me.</p>\n\n<p>Upon taking it, the creature speaks up. &quot;There&#39;ll be no weapons in the port. We&#39;ve had enough trouble as it is.&quot; His accent muddle his words over the clamor of the port.</p>\n\n<p>I nod. Lying. He feigns a welcome and wanders away while checking his logbook. He&#39;s looking down as he&#39;s walking and a small herd of willow beasts blocks his path. Startled, he looks up and exchanges words with the frail shepherd leading the animals. A discussion quickly breaks out between the two, but nothing of consequence. It&#39;s just a slight hiccup to the harried harbormaster and his functionary duties.</p>\n\n<p>As I watch the creature exchange words with the frail shepherd, my attention is drawn to the willow beasts that are blocking his path. These short, squat creatures are a common sight in the port. They are docile and calm, with long, white, waxy hairs that are used in everything from robes to rugs and pillows. They move slowly and steadily, their heads held low as they graze on the sparse vegetation that grows in the port&#39;s outskirts.</p>\n\n<p>As the sound of their hooves grinds against the hard concrete, I take another look at the small yellow chit in my hand. It grants me three days to spend and trade on Kelisia. Finding Resnick isn&#39;t likely to take me that long, I hope.</p>\n\n<p>The starport is bustling with activity. People and creatures of all manner mill about. More livestock cross in front of me, this time several cattle with massive jet-black orbs for eyes. The ink-colored orbs seem to disappear in the light as the beasts pass in front of me. Wordlessly, they are ushered away by a boy. He&#39;s too young to be this far from home. He has a soft face, though aged beyond his years with a mix of hard experience.</p>\n\n<p>I turn my attention to the freighter across the bustling path. A private vessel, she looks fast, expensive, and newly built. Her hull bears no name, a rare sight for a working ship. She&#39;s configured with six engines in the aft and two sizable lateral doors. A ship of her class this could carry four or five times that of <em>Opportune</em> — and she&#39;s armed. A round turret with long barrels is built into her topside.</p>\n\n<p>A group of Tu is working hard below the craft. Unloading the ship from the door, they grunt, clattering boxes. Working hard, they&#39;re toting crates of goods to the transfer carts that will haul them into the city for storage or sale. They&#39;re hefty males, muscular with pale blue skin, clothed in a traditional Tu garment known as a Khalali. The garment is an ivory colored, loose-fitting pullover worn with a cowl folded down. The Tu homeworld, a semi-arid desert planet known as Tukar, has gravity considerably stronger of the native human worlds. This allowed the oxygen-breathing Tu to evolve with dense bones and strong muscles.</p>\n\n<p>The light blue skin of a Tu is aposematic. A blue warning signal to any potential predator looking for a lean, meaty meal. The color comes from natural biological compounds produced in their bodies as a toxin. Their blood is poisonous to a variety of species, including mine. Unlike that of my species, their homeworld had no mass extinction event. Ancient beasts roam the scrublands of Tukar. These beasts, like the Tu, evolved with abnormally high gravity and became massive, ferocious predators. Despite the odds, millions of years of evolution proved favorable for the Tu. The toxins that evolved in their bodies now prevent the predatory nature of the predators of Tukar.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s such beauty in the supple skin of Tu. As a child, I remember looking up at the planet of Ogma from my grey, dusty home on its orbiting moon. I have memories of this planet, a pristine marble of watery blue oceans, mottled with white clouds. The delicate hues of a Tu&#39;s skin remind me of times when I would gaze into the dark sky from the stark lunar landscape, to find a brilliant blue sphere. A symbol of opportunity, floating in the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>Exiting <em>Opportune</em>, I turn right and begin walking towards the city center. Near the pristine freighter across the way, Tu&#39;s are sweating, unloading the craft. A large man is supervising them, barking orders. His tone is cross. The Tu does not waver. They do not increase their pace. The Tu seem accustomed to the man&#39;s abuse. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Quickly! Quickly, blue! I&#39;m not going to wait here all cycle. Hurry or no chow tonight for the lot of you!&quot; He yells, waving his arm. His voice, hoarse and grizzled, emits from a worn voice box in his thick neck.</p>\n\n<p>The man is older, bearded, and dressed in a simply wrapped garment with dark pants. He is short, portly. Hanging off his ample waist is a leather whip, curled around itself dangling from a belt. The Tu he commands are his own property. The whip is for reminding them of that. I doubt they often forget.</p>\n\n<p>The four pale-blue creature work efficiently, despite the incessant man&#39;s commands. The sound of crates being stacked, grunting and feet shuffling fills the air, over the hissing, cooling of starship engines and the hurried crowd of the port. Intrigued. I have to lean a bit to get a clear view of the group from my position under the starship <em>Opportune</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A tall Tu stands in the doorway of the craft handing rectangular wooden crates to another. His companion is stacking them on a loading cart. One large Tu wheels the cart out of the cargo hold and down a small ramp. It&#39;s piled high. Too High. Teetering and wobbling as it bounces down the ramp. The cart falls off-balance, thrown with a hastily assembled load. The Tu pushing the cart runs into a small divot on the landing pad and the wheel snags. Losing control, he tries to compensate, but the two top wooden crates fall and crash to the unforgiving concrete, shattering the containers. Their contents, large, exotic speckled eggs, burst open on impact. Shells and yolks scatter against the cement pad. The egg remains drip from the splintered crate as it lay mangled.</p>\n\n<p>Like a hawk, the man sees this and swoops in. He&#39;s taken with anger. &quot;Worthless animal!&quot; He yells. The man is furious, while fatly scurrying to the Tu, who is trying in vain to pick up the pieces of eggshell and golden-yellow yolks. He&#39;s sorting through the splinters of wood and shells to find any eggs that may be intact. His blue hands are dipped with the protein-rich yolks of the large Rhea eggs, these from the planet Talsma.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Stop! Stop you stupid tuke.&quot; The man bends down and scoops a dripping glob of egg onto his finger. Waving it in front of the Tu&#39;s face, &quot;Do you know how much each of these is worth? Hey, look at me!&quot; He asks, full of anger. He&#39;s directly confronting the large blue creature, waving his golden, fat finger. He grabs the Tu by the back of his hairless head and shoves the creature face first it into the pile of broken eggs. The Tu&#39;s body, head grasped by the man, bends over as the man yanks it downward. He holds a bent-over position until a kick of the man&#39;s boot forces him to rise again. The Tu straightens up and stumbles backward. Taking two steps backward, the creature is reeling from the force of the man&#39;s boot on his skull.</p>\n\n<p>In the colonies, the majority of Tu are considered property. They are bought, owned, and sold as any other work animal would be. They&#39;re not treated as creatures, but resources, rather than people. The agricultural colonies, in particular, Ogma and Talsma, rely heavily on this slave labor to grow crops and work the tea plantations. The Tu there are seldom educated, poorly understood.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent accidental poisonings, given the normally toxic nature of the blood of a Tu, a special diet is given to them when on a human world. It includes the consumption of a few ‘toxin host&#39; plants, which help their body to rid itself of the toxin systems in their blood. It makes them less poisonous to humans, but weakens their immune system, leaving them susceptible to a variety of diseases.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m disgusted by the man. My thoughts race. I shouldn&#39;t get involved. I can&#39;t. Ayers, the empire... Malik flashes through my mind. Our friendship and his passion will shortly weigh heavy on my next decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Standing straight up, the Tu shakes his head, motioning &quot;No&quot; to the previous question. The man continues to berate him. &quot;These are worth far, <em>far</em> more than you are.&quot; He flicks the egg off his finger. He steps forward and grabs the Tu by the collar dragging him off the loading ramp onto the cement landing pad. &quot;Get down.&quot; He commands, releasing the creature&#39;s clothing. The man reaches for the black whip on his side, unclasping it from a loop hanging off his stretched belt. He holds it in his right hand and opens his grasp. The whip uncurls, its dark tail falls to the ground.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Get. Down. NOW.&quot; He&#39;s more than stern.</p>\n\n<p>They are witnessing the disturbance — the tempo of the working Tu increase. One uprights the cart, another shies away from the man while collecting the fallen splintered crates. With the offending Tu now on his knees, the man pulls back his thick arm. The tail of the whip follows the arc of his strike. The whip cuts across the spine of the Tu, slicing his Khalali. The crack of the whip frightens the rest of working creature. They flinch as sound lashes their souls.</p>\n\n<p>Against all logic, and ignoring all sense of self-preservation, I reach under my cloak and unclip the retaining clasp of <em>Reason to Believe</em>. I trot across the way towards the freighter, dodging an outgoing transfer cart as well as a mass of hurried people. I know my weapon is loaded because I, regretfully, did not shoot Ayers — only because he handed it to me empty.</p>\n\n<p>Whip raised once more; the man notices the other Tu looking at me. He turns to watch my advance on him and ignores from the cowering, pale-blue creature. Unsure of what I was going to do once I reached the man, I stop at a safe distance. Swing open the right side of my cloak, showing the wood laid handle of my pistol lying in a loosely belted holster that&#39;s low around my waist.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; I say with authority. &quot;Leave these creatures in peace.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The working Tu watch in awe, trying to complete their tasks through the unbelievable distraction. I&#39;m almost as surprised at myself as they are.</p>\n\n<p>The man turns, perhaps more stunned than the Tu. He&#39;s more surprised by my stoic approach than my simple, yet threatening, weapon. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; He asks, unsure of my words. &quot;I suggest you be on your way. Mind your own affairs, and leave me be.&quot; He makes a shooing motion with his free hand.</p>\n\n<p>I posture with more aggression. &quot;I shall not hesitate.&quot; I say, resting my hand on my sidearm. It&#39;s cool to the touch. </p>\n\n<p>Now, the wheels were set into motion. There was no going back. For better, or worse, I decided to intervene. With my thumb, I sense the delicate knurling on the hammer of <em>Reason to Believe</em>. I visualize placing the sights of my bloodthirsty pistol on this mans head. As if a computer, my body has the kill program loaded and it&#39;s ready to execute. I need only to will it so.</p>\n\n<p>I have yet to draw. Unafraid, he chuckles. &quot;This Tuke is my mine. I&#39;ll do what I want with it. And you? You&#39;re a fool. Off with you before I fetch the star guard.&quot; He snorts over the sound of the crowd and the ships while emphasizing his use of &quot;tuke,&quot; a derogatory term for the Tu kind.</p>\n\n<p><em>Reason to Believe</em> slides out of its holster. Upon its removal, my cloak softly folds shut. During the motion, I take a firing stance. My body and it&#39;s newly attached weapon point directly at the large man holding the whip. Less than two pounds of pressure applied to the trigger mechanism would send a bullet screaming into the man&#39;s plump head, splattering its contents against the hull of the ship behind him. Fighting <em>Reason to Believe</em>, I don&#39;t pull it.</p>\n\n<p>Looking past the man, the beaten Tu sits on his knees. He&#39;s averting his eyes from me, fearing further punishment. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Go on, Tu.&quot; I yell, finishing with &quot;GO!&quot;. His master lays frozen in my sights. It takes a moment for the Tu to process what is happening. He stands and runs. His bloody garment and blue body disappear into the crowd. The others while half working, watch his departure, keeping up their distracted efforts.</p>\n\n<p>The man gazes over my shoulder. I turn my head, breaking my lock on him. Imperial guards by the old clipper are looking in our direction, pointing through the crowd indicating to each other. One of them takes a final drag off his cigarette and flicks it to the ground, in preparation for the short walk over. I&#39;m not looking to tussle with the king&#39;s guard.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking back at the man. I know he sees what&#39;s happening, his eyes shift between me, my weapon, and the imperial guards dressed in white and red. The sound of live birds in crates passes behind me, as cargo and people continue about their business in the starport, although the crowds have yet to notice.</p>\n\n<p>No words are exchanged between the man and I. He is struck with fear, staring down the barrel of my weapon. Across the port, the guards are slow in picking up their gear. They are oddly reluctant to deal with this dangerous situation. Two of the previously working Tu have stopped. They are now gaping at me with disbelief while holding wooden crates. I feel the stare of the guards burning in the back of my head. I cannot win — the momentum shifts. I open my cloak holstering my weapon. Hastily, I turn and run. I blend with the outflowing crowd headed down the center of the port. My pace quickens as guilt, fear, and embarrassment wash over me.</p>\n\n<p>The man yells over the crowd, I only hear parts. &quot;— near my ship again, and it&#39;ll be you on the ground.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I hurry out of the port area while looking back to see if I&#39;m being followed by the guards. People brush past me. There&#39;s no sign of the guards. I turn once again to walk with the herd and step onto the street in front of the starport terminal building. My heart is racing. I can&#39;t believe what I did. Something inside of me wanted to pull the trigger. The reasonable part of my brain reminds me that in a crowded starport, that would have ended poorly.</p>\n\n<p>Walking deeper into the city, I recount my actions as I calm down. The Tu owner was breaking no law. Being his property, there was no wrongdoing in the eyes of the empire. Although rash, I was compelled to do <em>something</em>. I could not bear it, I couldn&#39;t help but think of Malik, and imagining him in this situation. </p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t sure what I expected. Was he going to let his Tu free because I drew down on him? Was I expecting to not draw any attention to myself doing that in the middle of the starport? I&#39;m humiliated by my foolishness, and a little disappointed I didn&#39;t end him right there.</p>\n\n<p>And what&#39;s to happen to the rest of the Tu he owns? There will surely be punishment. If the man couldn&#39;t take it out on me, he&#39;s likely to take it out on the Tu. The thought strikes me that I may have inadvertently doomed that entire group.</p>\n\n<p>My worry and fear are juxtaposed by what appears to be an average, cold afternoon in the city of Carit. People finishing their business, shops are closing up as two of the three suns dip low in the mountainous horizon. I make a right turn and head down a hilly avenue lined with shops and residences. I&#39;m passed by groups of people and small-wheeled vehicles puffing grey smoke as they putter along.</p>\n\n<p>Fearful of another encounter with the king&#39;s finest, I head down a narrow street that branches up a hill from the avenue. There I discover a tavern with a wooden sign above that reads &quot;The Welburn.&quot; The sign has a stylized deer carved into the grainy wood. It looks pre-war, wooden, and old. The two-story building lies on a raised stone foundation with narrow steps leading to the old wooden front door. I decide it&#39;s best to lay low for the evening and walk up the slight incline towards the building.</p>\n\n<p>As I approached the tavern, my eyes were drawn to the wooden cart parked next to the entrance. A grizzled woodsman stood behind it, his calloused hands gripping the edge of the cart as he tried to solicit customers from the passerby. The furs piled high upon the cart looked as if they were freshly caught, still drying in the cool evening air. Some were fashioned into hats and shawls, hanging from small hooks that were attached to the cart. The dark furs stood out in stark contrast to the wooden cart, and I couldn&#39;t help but be drawn to their intricate patterns and rich colors.</p>\n\n<p>The woodsman noticed me approaching and called out, &quot;Fine furs, have a look.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by the quality of his wares. The furs looked soft and warm, perfect for the chilly evenings on this planet. But the other passerby ignored his call and continued on their way. The woodsman didn&#39;t seem discouraged and gave me a kind smile and a friendly wish for a good evening as I walked past him and up the slight incline towards the tavern.</p>\n\n<p>As I walked, I couldn&#39;t help but be reminded of why this planet was named the Athylian word for &quot;coyote&quot;. The rich colors of the furs and the intricate patterns reminded me of the coyotes that roamed the planet&#39;s wilderness. They were known for their cunning and adaptability, traits that I couldn&#39;t help but feel were reflected in the furs that the woodsman was selling.</p>\n\n<p>The interior of the Welburn Inn is badly lit. There&#39;s a long bar opposite the entrance, and round tables are along the wall to my left. To the right is a wide wooden set of stairs leading to the accommodations in the upper level. There&#39;s only a handful of patrons. Three men are sitting at the bar drinking out of metal cups, and a younger man in a hooded cloak eats a dark stew at one of the tables. The light of the suns shines yellow through the small windows near the table. Coals burns low in the hearth. I walk towards it, as though I&#39;m warming up, but covertly ensuring there are no imperial guards on this floor.</p>\n\n<p>As I approach the crackling fire, I feel its warmth beckoning me closer. I reach out my hands, cupping them in front of the flames as they dance and flicker, illuminating my skin in a golden glow. The heat seeps deep into my bones, chasing away the shakiness from earlier and leaving me feeling rejuvenated. The woman behind the counter, with her wavy dark brown hair cascading down her shoulders and her big brown eyes, inquires about adding another log to the fire. I shake my head, content with the warmth already radiating through my body. She nods understandingly and turns back to her conversation with a male patron at the bar. I take in the rest of the room, noting the cozy ambiance and the patrons scattered throughout. I make my way to the bar, choosing a seat closest to the fire, just five spaces down from the group of bearded men at the opposite end.</p>\n\n<p>The warmth envelops me.</p>\n\n<p>Kelesians have a deep love and respect for what lies in the forests and wilds. They are renowned hunters and tanners and dress according to their lifestyle. Typical garb includes fur of some kind, hoods, jackets, warm boots, and facial hair. Lots of facial hair. I don&#39;t blend in here.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Would ye be wantin&#39; somethin&#39; to eat, then? We&#39;ve got a lovely spig stew goin&#39; if ye&#39;re peckish.&quot; The aproned woman asks. I get the sense she may think I&#39;m lost.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No. Thank you.&quot; I say and pause. &quot;Zalara?&quot; I ask after wondering if I should. </p>\n\n<p>She frowns and shakes her head. &quot;Never heard of it.&quot; She says.</p>\n\n<p>I look around. The bearded men at another end the bar are drinking something out of a dull tinned tumbler, the foam sets on their beards as they sip, brush it away and repeat.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll have one of those,&quot; I say, pointing the men&#39;s mugs. The woman turns to tap and fills a metal cup with hay-yellow liquid with a creamy thick foam on top.</p>\n\n<p>I would come to know this beverage as Talg, a local brew that is indeed heavily foamy and thick. Talg is made from fermented herbs and roots. It gives off a musty alcohol scent and is served warm.</p>\n\n<p>She sets the lathery beverage on the worn wood in front of me and says, &quot;We only take coin of the empire, if ye catch me drift.&quot; I get it. I&#39;m not from here.</p>\n\n<p>Remembering Malik&#39;s payment I nod, reaching into my cloak and open the small black pouch given to me by my Tu friend. I take out a single scoret coin and set it on the bar. The woman&#39;s perception of my strangeness increases. Not only do I look like I&#39;m from another planet, I also seem to carry large denominations of freshly minted imperial money. The lifts the heavy coin from the bar and inserts it into a slotted pocket in her apron.</p>\n\n<p>I take the cold mug, touch it to my lips. It&#39;s horrible. I have no idea how the men at the other end of the bar drink it. I grimace at the taste and set it back down, yet the earthy, salty taste of Talg is unrelenting and lingers in my mouth.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What be bringin&#39; ye into town?&quot; The woman casually asks with the coin now stored in her apron. I sense her intrigue. Her cheeks are rosy and has a friendly face.</p>\n\n<p>I have trouble swallowing the swill. &quot;Looking for some...&quot;, I paused to clear the liquid from my throat, &quot;...friends of mine.&quot; It was best I could come up with the foul taste of this awful liquid seizing my thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well now, ye&#39;ve come to the right spot. Our Welburn here is the finest tavern in all of Carit, it is. Why, anyone who&#39;s anyone stays here at the Welburn, they do.&quot; She&#39;s a proud Kelesian and waits for my response by leaning into the bar. After an awkward delay, I smile and nod.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that right, Moryl?&quot; She says loudly, turning to the man sitting closest to me at the bar. He raises his glass, and once again ingests a large quantity of the foamy liquid, coating his beard in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back at me, she leans away from the bar. &quot;Well now, if&#39;n ye be wantin&#39; that stew, or if ye&#39;ll be needin&#39; a room fer the night, ye just let me know.&quot; She walks over to the gentlemen at the other end of the bar. I once again take hold of the beverage and give it another chance, and instantly regret my decision.</p>\n\n<p>Sitting at the bar, my thoughts lead to Malik. The person who gave me the money to buy this terrible beverage, who also happens to be a Tu. A Tu not unlike those owned and enslaved by the fat man. What cruelty Malik he faced? What hardships has he endured? Malik has always been an ally. He lied about the Resnick contract, and he&#39;s right I wouldn&#39;t have done it had I known what it truly was. I want to tell him what&#39;s happening, how I&#39;m forced into this decision, how I need to bring Resnick back alive. I can&#39;t though. He, being an ally of Resnick, would compromise any chance of reaching him. I have to do this alone.</p>\n\n<p>I hear a warm male voice. &quot;Lovely as usual, Eda.&quot; The hooded man who was once sitting at the table along the wall appears at the bar to my left. He&#39;s between the men at the far end and is returning the now eaten dish of stew. Not a drop left on the plate.</p>\n\n<p>Eda, the woman looks at him from the far end but doesn&#39;t walk over. &quot;Such a dear. Will ye be stayin&#39; the night?&quot; She asks sweetly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Nay, madam. We&#39;re headed out this nightfall. Up Hoarfrost ridge. Tracking a large herd.&quot; He says while dropping R&#39;s smoothing his H&#39;s, the telltale sign of someone whose native language is Perseid. He looks strong, fair-skinned with a dark mustache and a five cycle beard with flecks of peppered grey throughout. Whatever he&#39;s tracking doesn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>\n\n<p>He notices me with an almost full mug of foaming sewer juice. &quot;Well.&quot; He pauses to look me over. &quot;Hello there.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>I offer a feigning &quot;Hello.&quot; with a nod, trying to brush him off.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And what brings a woman like you, into a place like this?&quot; He flirts, leaning one arm on the bar.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I seek a group of traders. Maybe you&#39;ve seen them?&quot; I say with a chill in my voice, and my face turned from him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Perhaps. Perhaps not. Many folks come through here, lass. Tell me, how would I know it is them?&quot; He&#39;s teasing, attempting to pursue me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The banner they fly. It&#39;s Blue. With three stars and a creature.&quot; I say, describing the colors flown by the unit on Bowenn II.</p>\n\n<p>The words fall, and his body language shifts. The flirting ends, he stands up straight and removes his arm from the bar.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I see.&quot; He takes a pause, and his body language turns rotten. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know—but if I were you, I&#39;d keep who you&#39;re friends with to yourself around here.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>Turning away from me, &quot;Eda, I&#39;m off.&quot; He says and leaves. Her polite response hangs in the air.</p>\n\n<p>I struck a nerve. Whomever I&#39;m looking for doesn&#39;t have friends here. But it sounds like I&#39;m in the right place.</p>\n\n<p>Night falls on the city. The yellow sun shining through the small windows fades into a purple twilight. Eda notices my aversion to the beverage and finds something more suitable to my taste. The men at the end of the bar happily down what I couldn&#39;t drink. More people being filling the tavern. She throws two dried logs onto the fire, and it reignites with warmth, the tavern fills with the Kelesian spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Thought the night, my attempts at asking about the people I met on Bowenn were met with a fearful ignorance, no matter the details I omit. In an admission of defeat, I ask Eda for an order of her spig stew. It arrives steaming hot and smells delightful — chunks of tender spig meat in a succulent, red gravy. Digging in, the first bite is delightful. The gravy is thick and flavorful. The meat falls apart in my mouth and is complimented by a large hunk of fresh bread soaked in the gravy. The stew cooks for hours, maybe even entire cycles. It&#39;s a dish that can be left to cook, a meal that rewards the caretakers. It&#39;s a meal of hard work and dedication. The meal of the people of Kelesia.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>After the meal, I gather myself and head into the chilly night. The woodsman who was once selling his fine furs has moved on. Across the street, there&#39;s a small engine repair shop with dilapidated vehicles parked at its curb. No streetlights shine. Above the city are moonless heavens, filled with bright shining stars. The eastern sky has the faint glow of the third sun below the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>I turn down the hill, bracing for the cold. A dark figure in the street is walking up the hill. It is a wide thing, if it is a man, he must be quite broad. I fear it&#39;s the man from the starport. It comes closer. The figure stops, looking up at me, and hurries up the hill. Stepping back, I reach for my weapon; it&#39;s cold to the touch.</p>\n\n<p>From a distance, I hear a low voice with a strange accent. &quot;Captain?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who goes there? Show yourself.&quot; I say, with my hand under my cloak grasping <em>Reason to Believe</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Are you the captain of the starship <em>Opportune</em>?&quot; The approaching voice asks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am... what of it?&quot; I respond with uncertainty into the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>The figure draws closer. It has the body of a burly Tu. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Captain, please. I am a friend. My name is Hahl Zaro.&quot; The Tu greets me with a hastened traditional Tu greeting of bowing slightly and while clasping his hands. I stand and observe—not being much for formal greetings.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I have come on behalf of Reda Lokan.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who?&quot; I ask, while under my cloak, my hand leaves my weapon.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come, we have much to discuss.&quot; He says, waving me back into the finest tavern in Carit.</p>\n\n<p>Reentering the Welburn, Eda looks up from her work and notices I&#39;ve returned, and I&#39;m not alone. She goes back to cleaning mugs. Hahl gestures for me to sit at one of the tables near the wall, and I do.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Excellent, you are seated.&quot; He states the obvious. &quot;I am glad to have met you, for you seemed to be leaving.&quot; He says, his golden eyes shine in the firelight, along with his pale blue face.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. And...&quot; I say waiting for him to pick up the conversation. He doesn&#39;t, so I continue. &quot;...I was going back to my ship.&quot; Who is this creature? What does he want? Was Reda Lokan the Tu that I freed?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very good.&quot; He smiles and continues. &quot;Reda Lokan has given me a message. He said you wanted to help us. Ah, help him and his Tu.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Help you? I never said that. Help you do what?&quot; I ask, waving off Eda as she comes by to either have more small talk or deliver me more terrible drinks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Reda Lokan claims you have proven yourself. You were strong-hearted and faced his master during this most important night we are approaching. He believes you are a gift, sent to help free us.&quot; His palms are flat on the table, his eyes looking into mine.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I see,&quot; I say, thinking for a moment, I continue. &quot;I am not whom you think I am. Friend, assure you, I am no gift.&quot; I explain. Eda did not catch the wave-off signal, and she approaches the table. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah, yer friend showed up.&quot; She says with a smile, standing at the table. &quot;And how be ye, me dear?&quot; She asks Hahl, turning to him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very well. Yes, very well.&quot; He says with more enthusiasm than this place has <em>ever</em> seen.</p>\n\n<p>She nods, &quot;A pint or two fer ye both?&quot; Turning back to me.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time as I&#39;m saying &quot;No, thanks.&quot; and thinking, &quot;Please not again.&quot; Hahl says, &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; Eda nods at Hahl and walks away with the order.</p>\n\n<p>He turns back to me. &quot;What may we call you?&quot; He asks.</p>\n\n<p>Eda&#39;s kindness breaks me. &quot;Amal,&quot; I say, giving in.</p>\n\n<p>He acknowledges with a nod. &quot;Amal, there are too few people like you. People who care about Tu and about Tu lives.&quot; He pleads.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I told you, I&#39;m not whom you think I am. I am far too busy at the moment and haven&#39;t the time to help you. Or your people.&quot; I say, gesturing horizontally with my palms.</p>\n\n<p>He looks down and thinks for a moment. &quot;I see. Shall I tell our friends you will not be assisting us? Reda Lokan and his Tu will be saddened.&quot; He lets the words hang in the warm air of the tavern for a moment. The crackle of the fire burns through the silence. </p>\n\n<p>The thought of finding Resnick strikes me. &quot;What <em>friends</em>?&quot; I ask curiously.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Reda Lokan has many friends, like you. Cunning, brave. Keen on freedom.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>Eda returns with our drinks. Two metal mugs, filled with my least favorite Kelesian beverage. &quot;Here ya are, me dear&quot; Eda says while setting down the foamy drinks.</p>\n\n<p>Hahl immediately reaches for the mug with both hands and puts it in the center of his large blue face. I watch him swallow two, three times. His bulking neck muscles propel the beverage into his body. Setting down the drink, he wipes the white foam from his mouth with his sleeve.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is good, this.&quot; He exclaims with a wet smile.</p>\n\n<p>I refocus his attention. &quot;Hahl. Can you tell me about your friends? I need to know. What colors do they carry? What banner do they fly?&quot; I ask intently, setting the metal mug aside.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A flag of blue. With a triptych of stars surrounding a Kelesia.&quot; He pauses for a moment. &quot;Do you know of this, Amal?&quot; Watching my face, his eyes light up. He&#39;s excited. &quot;Are you also with friends of the Tu? Oh! Reda Lokan will be beside himself when he hears of this great tale of fortune!&quot; Hahl is beside himself.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No, Hahl, I do not know them. Though, I would like to meet them.&quot; I say, pausing for a moment and looking directly at him. &quot;If I help you, will you take me to them?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course! You will like them, for you are the same kind of people. Strange. Actually quite strange... however, indeed brave.&quot; He says while taking another large gulp of the drink Eda brought us.</p>\n\n<p>I nod in agreement, and he continues. &quot;Tonight, I will give the word to Reda Lokan. In the dark morning, we shall look in the western sky, to the sacred star of Kekeios. When it is highest, The fat man should be distracted, so Reda Lokan and his Tu are able to overwhelm him.&quot; He pauses to take another drink. &quot;They then shall flee to the shore of the great lake, to a hidden ganan, where our friends will take them to freedom.&quot; He casually explains, as if he&#39;s done this before.</p>\n\n<p>I only have one question. &quot;What do you need me to do?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You must coax the man from his ship.&quot; He says matter of factly. &quot;Once out, Reda Lokan and his Tu will escape.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. All right.&quot; I say, nodding and gaining confidence, trying to visualize the plan.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Do you understand? It is so often hard to tell what your species is thinking.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, fine,&quot; I say, going over it in my head.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Time is important now. I am glad we have met Amal. I must give the word to Reda Lokan.&quot; He stops before standing up. &quot;Would you like to finish this?&quot;, sliding the half gone beverage to me. &quot;It&#39;s quite good.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; I say sarcastically.</p>\n\n<p>He stands, &quot;Look to Kekeios, act when it is highest in the sky. May the light of Tukar shine upon you.&quot; He says standing, with his large blue hand on my shoulder. I&#39;m reminded of the firm grip of Malik&#39;s hand on my shoulder when we were in the Queen&#39;s Club, and can only assume touching one&#39;s shoulder is a common Tu custom.</p>\n\n<p>Hahl leaves me at the tavern. I look at the metal mug and listen to the crackling fire. &quot;Maybe what I did today wasn&#39;t for nothing,&quot; I say to myself, and take a sip.</p>\n\n<h1>14</h1>\n\n<p>A chill hangs in the air of the quiet anchorage of Kelesia. &quot;Look to Kekeios, act when it is highest in the sky...&quot; Hahl&#39;s words ring in my mind. The starships are all night in, and only a handful of path lights illuminate the walkways. The multitude of space beasts lay waiting for daybreak. In the sky, the third and smallest of the suns is low. It&#39;s a faint bulb of bluish light, far less luminescent than its massive brothers. The row of ships has no lights, aside from a few of the cabin windows glowing yellow. The low antenna building near <em>Opportune</em> has a red beacon atop its roof. The cycling amber glow illuminates and fades. Again and again, casting a web of shadows on the ground beneath my ship.</p>\n\n<p>I rub my hands together to warm them as I stand behind tall containers between my ship and the modern freighter. I hear footsteps and a voice. A man walks down the shadowy path. He&#39;s unaware of my presence. Stumbling along, he&#39;s humming a tune to himself. I watch him stroll and wobble to a ship far down the center road of the starport. He climbs into his craft, and it is once again quiet.</p>\n\n<p>I look at the western sky and find Kekeios in the constellation Lodi. The constellation is of a ferocious bear, with its snout turned towards the northern sky. The legend of Lodi well known throughout the galaxy. It says there was once a man whose greed for scoret caused him never to leave his mining camp high in the mountains. He spent his whole life mining for scoret, until one day a hungry bear visited him at his lonely camp. The man feared not the bear, for the man&#39;s only fear was not finding the minerals buried in the hills, and becoming poor. Blinded by greed and unafraid, the bear swallowed him whole. Legend holds the man lives on inside the bear, forever unable to quench his desire for scoret.</p>\n\n<p>Stepping out from the shadows, I approach the freighter cautiously, wondering if Reda Lokan has received Hahl&#39;s message. The landing pad is eerily quiet, with only the faint barking of a distant dog and the low hum of the city breaking the silence. I spot a piece of concrete on the ground and pick it up, weighing it in my hand as I consider the best way to throw it. With a quick motion, I lob it at the bow of the ship and it hits the hull with a loud bang, shattering on the ground. I hold my breath and listen for any signs of movement from within the ship, but all remains quiet.</p>\n\n<p>Searching the ground at my feet, there&#39;s more crumbly bits of cement and large metal containers—nothing to throw. I open my cloak and unholster my pistol. Checking the breach, it&#39;s loaded. I&#39;m directly at the port side bridge window of the new sleek freighter. I take a firing stance. Squeezing the trigger sends a slug railing into the composite glass window. The report of the weapon echoes far louder than I would have hoped, a sudden crack of gunpowder amid the dark, cold night.</p>\n\n<p>The ship takes no damage, but the sound of the gun and the impact of the slug is enough for a light to come on through a window. A small head peers through and looks down upon me. It stares at me for a moment and disappears. Moments later, the first lateral door of the freighter unlocks and whirrs open. It folds downward, once in it&#39;s fully open position, it acts as a ramp into the cargo hold of the ship. Internal lights shine onto the ramp area, illuminating a sizable golden swath below the vessel and its loading ramp.</p>\n\n<p>Standing at the entrance of the opened lateral door is the man from before, wearing the same clothes, and carrying the same plump gut. This time, he is wielding a long single barrel shotgun.</p>\n\n<p>He&#39;s genuinely surprised to see me. &quot;You? Again?&quot; He squints, looking at me in the darkness. &quot;I told you not to come round my ship no more!&quot; He yells, stepping down slowly onto the ramp, keeping his distance.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let them go, and you walk away,&quot; I say, glancing around in case I need to dive to cover. My hand is at my waist, ready to draw.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who? My Tuke? You already owe me for the one that run off.&quot; He chuckles. &quot;Better figure out how you&#39;re gonna pay up now.&quot; He cocks the shotgun. A shell now sits in the firing chamber of his weapon. &quot;Ah, I guess I&#39;ll have to shoot you and take whatever you got on you.&quot; He takes aim at me standing near the metal canister. Before his weapon reaches his shoulder, I quickly tuck behind the barriers as a blast from his shotgun tears them apart.</p>\n\n<p>When the sound subsides, I yell, &quot;Last warning, let them go!&quot; from behind the canisters. He blasts them once more, a deafening sound echoes through the starport. It is followed by the faint clicking sound of the breech opening of his weapon to begin reloading.</p>\n\n<p>I need to take him down. Before I can line up my shot, I peer out of the opposite side of the canisters. Three figures appear behind the man. They&#39;re wearing ivory-colored Khalalis.</p>\n\n<p>The man turns and shouts at them while pointing at me still behind the barriers. &quot;What took you idiots so long? Go down there and get her. Now!&quot; He commands, still fumbling with his smoking shotgun, breech open, an empty shell was not fully ejected.</p>\n\n<p>More Tu appear in the doorway, by now the full crew is present. &quot;Are you <em>all</em> stupid? I said go get her and bring her over here. She&#39;s about to learn a lesson.&quot; He says to the crew.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You hear that? You&#39;re done. I&#39;m gonna whip you good—like I do these spigs.&quot; He&#39;s Shouting to me while I remain hidden. I hear the metallic click his weapon after he finally loads another shell.</p>\n\n<p>He turns once again to his crew. However, something is tremendously wrong. &quot;What—what is this?&quot; He asks. The crew approaches him. He takes partial aim from the hip and fires a powerful shot haphazardly into the group. One Tu gets hit in the shoulder. He howls in pain and falls to the ramp with a grunt and a thud. The man attempts to chamber another round, but the Tu&#39;s rush him. He is overwhelmed. While crouched behind the containers, I hear fat screams, muffled gagging. The clank of his weapon falling to the metal ramp clatters over the sound of the scuffle. The man is gasping for air, insulting the Tu with his last breath. For he is like Lodi, unafraid of the bear.</p>\n\n<p>I emerge from cover to find the Tu who was beaten earlier in the day standing over the body of the man. He must have been picked up, returned like a stray animal, and brought back to his owner. During that time, I imagine he was able to get word to Hahl. Able to describe me and what happened earlier.</p>\n\n<p>I glance at the body of the man, his face cold and still, strangled by the whip he used so brutally on these Tu&#39;s. The wounded Tu was hit in the shoulder. He&#39;s laying on the ramp, blood covering the side of this Khalali. Another Tu helps him to his feet. He&#39;s grimacing in pain.</p>\n\n<p>Once the wounded Tu is standing, the leader slings the shotgun and approaches me. I&#39;m standing at the bottom of the ramp, next to a set of damaged, leaking containers with my pistol is still in my hand at my side. I&#39;m trying to take this all in. I am surprised, yes, but unsure what I expected if it was other than this.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am Reda Lokan.&quot; He says in a deep voice. Reda is larger than the Tu I met in the tavern, even bigger than Malik—but has the same piercing yellow eyes. &quot;These are my Tu.&quot; He waves his hand at three blue creatures standing on the loading ramp. They both gaze at me through the faint light of the cargo bay.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Quickly—we must get to the ganan.&quot; Reda says the Athyilian word for boat launch while waving for the others down the ramp.</p>\n\n<p>The group of four Tu, including Reda, scramble to the dock in the night. I rush to follow them. We leave the quiet starport without anyone spotting us, but three shotgun blasts in a starport in the middle of the night will surely attract some imperial attention. Leaving the port, we come around the far side, turning away from the main avenue and down a dark path leading to the edge of the city.</p>\n\n<p>The Tu follow the path that skirts the edge of the city. Our escape is well planned. It feels rehearsed. After passing through dark passageways and dim alleys, we come to a dead end. Here, the city&#39;s outer wall terminates the quiet street. Reda motions silently, pointing ahead and to the left of the group, towards a crumbling section of the stone wall. The leader takes us behind a stack of wooden crates. Following him, I feel a cold wind, and discover a crumbling hole in the city&#39;s ancient outer defense. </p>\n\n<p>The Tu and I climb through the chink in the imperial armor. The other side is dark and forested. As we&#39;re briskly moving through the cold night, Reda speaks in a whisper. &quot;Thank you for coming. I knew you were a gift.&quot; His first words since we&#39;ve left the port.</p>\n\n<p>I nod and focus on walking. The way forward is dark, and down a moderate hill, there are no houses. No lights. We enter a thickly wooded area, guided only by the stars above shining through the leaves of the trees. The city is left behind us. Fallen branches and foliage crunch beneath our hurried feet. We walk for a kilometer or more. The group takes turns carrying the injured Tu, and speak to each other in what I can only assume is the language of Tukar. Reda is the leader. He&#39;s calm and in control. This whole ordeal is odd to me, but I feel safe.</p>\n\n<p>It is much colder once we reach the bottom of the hill. The coldest I&#39;ve been since I&#39;ve landed on this planet. Over our footsteps, I hear the splashing of water. A shoreline was near. We must be close to the lake. Ahead, a small point of light flashes three times in our direction.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;That is them,&quot; Reda says, whispering in the dark wilderness.</p>\n\n<p>Our pace quickens, and the light flashes three times more. This time it&#39;s far brighter, and the sound of the lake is considerably louder. Plunk. Plunk. The waves lap an old wooden pier. We step out of the forest onto a sandy beach, in the light of the stars I can see the blackness of lake and bits of driftwood on the beach. The air here is crisp and chilled.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Over here!&quot; I hear an unidentified loud whisper.</p>\n\n<p>The group changes direction slightly under the charge of Reda, and we step off the sandy beach onto a jetty. There a boat is moored to the pier at our left. In it are two faces lit with dim red sodium lamps. One is carrying a metal signal lamp, the source of the yellow flashes. The smallish men are armed with older rifles and are wearing light uniforms in the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>The one with the single lamp whispers, &quot;We thought you would never arrive. The suns will be up soon—quickly.&quot; He gestures to the group in the dark purple morning.</p>\n\n<p>Reda&#39;s group of Tu lifts and sets their injured into the boat, working as a team to carry him over the threshold of the dock and onto the craft. One by one they each file into the seesawing craft. One of the soldiers is helping them aboard, while the other holds the dim lantern. Reda is the last Tu aboard, followed by myself. A soldier helps me aboard.</p>\n\n<p>He swings the sodium lamp into my face and looks at me. For a moment, I think he recognizes me, but he says nothing, only capturing the image of my face with his mind. He shines the faint red light, so the other men have enough light to move. &quot;Careful.&quot; He whispers. I step off the dock and onto the boat with the waiting team. The soldier carrying the signal unties a single mooring line and pushes us off the dock with his boot. Freezing water splashes and clops against the hull of the small boat. He carefully steps his way aft between the group of escaped Tu and starts the small outboard pulse engine. Unlike the engines of the skiffs on Bowenn, this is muffled. It purrs much quieter.</p>\n\n<p>The small engine springs alive. We turn away from the dock, and power along the murky shoreline. After traveling for a bit at low speed, the young man at the aft opens the throttle, and we rip through the water at full speed. The wind is cutting and cold. In the dim light, I scan the faces of the Tu, wearing nothing but thin Khalalis. They are uncomfortable, fearful, and weary. The faces of the soldiers tell a different story. They are young, full of passion, pride, and determination. </p>\n\n<p>Amid the bumping of the boat and the rush of the wind, I slide over to the Tu who is now caring for his injured companion. Unsure if he speaks my language, I touch his shoulder while looking at his injured friend next to him. Reda across from us sees this and nods at me. The wind is fierce, it would be impossible to have a conversation. Without words, we are all thinking the same thing. The price of freedom is high.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Two of the three suns of Kelesia peak over a distant ridge. I&#39;m reminded of the man at the inn and wonder if that&#39;s the ridge he spoke of, where his group would be tracking their big game. Steep mountains covered in forests surround us. The lake is inky and ocean-like with white-capped waves. There are no signs of civilization here, no houses or people, or ships—we are alone in the famed wilds of Kelesia. Above, the stars begin to dim and the sky glows blue and orange and purple. The boat heads for a small inlet surrounded by short evergreen trees, against a rocky beach.</p>\n\n<p>The small pulse engine revs down until shutting off. We drift to a small dock at the far end of the inlet, much like the one we departed from hours earlier. One of the two soldiers, clad in a blue uniform like the others, extends an oar to catch the dock and expertly swing the boat into the docking position. He hops out, rocking the ship slightly to attach a mooring line. Beyond the pier is nothing but trees, a dense coniferous forest beneath a mountain. In the quiet I hear native birds singing in the amid the trees, waking up after a cold night of sleeping by the lake.</p>\n\n<p>With the boat secured to the jetty, we disembark. A soldier and one Tu leave the boat first. They turn and help the wounded Tu, lifting him onto the wooden pier. I climb out. Needing no assistance, I turn to help others. I grab Reda by the arms, steadying him. The last soldier grabs his big pack, and I help him out of the craft as well.</p>\n\n<p>Our group stands on the shore. Beneath the jetty, we look into the watery inlet, as the warm sun&#39;s rise above us. The two junior soldiers are adjusting their dark packs. They&#39;re wearing ratty blueish grey uniforms with long, white-trimmed coats with high collars and hats of colored felt, rounded with a short brim. They have pre-war long rifles with wooden stocks, old model bolt actions. One I assume to be the leader of the group is still carrying the signal lamp he used earlier in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The safe house is ahead.&quot; The young leader says. With his rifle is slung over his shoulder, pointing to a narrow dirt path leading into the nearby tree line.</p>\n\n<p>He leads the group and me away from the dock, and we enter the forest through a small natural arch in the trees. One soldier, the signaler, takes the lead. The other follows the group from behind. The path is not well-traveled, lined with tall trees and fallen branches and thick underbrush. Sticks and leaves crunch under our feet, and the dirt path winds up a hill along a flowing stream. The not yet frozen stream ends in the lake below, but we are now too deep in the trees to see it feeding into the crystal water.</p>\n\n<p>These forests are dense and disorienting. I imagine what imperial forces had to contend with during the war. This tightly packed woodland is ideal for guerrilla tactics. During the Kelesian ground war, Confederate sharpshooters would climb high into the trees and wait in camouflaged platforms for the king&#39;s men to pass below. Sometimes having to wait for days at a time, they were solitary, focused men and women. Their packs were well stocked with both food and ammunition. Once an imperial patrol passed close enough, the sharpshooters would target and kill imperial officers, and quickly escape swinging away during the panic. Patrols who survived these attacks were left leaderless and learned to fear every sound of the forest.</p>\n\n<p>The group hikes up a hill, and I brush off the overgrown branches and leaves vying to touch any part of my body they can. The path steepens, and we crest a rocky ridge. At the top, we pause to overlook a spacious, lush valley below. The valley floor is scattered with only a handful of small houses, and a small creek runs along its middle.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lilia Hollow.&quot; The lead soldier says. We collectively stop and peer into the valley below. Morning light shines through the dissipating fog. It is fleeting and kisses the land like a nights lover departing all too early in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>Overlooking the lush valley, I feel the twinge of my chilled face. I sniffle, breathing heavy from the hike up. The view is an attractive reward for that bit of exercise.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And there&#39;s the house.&quot; The lead soldier says, looking at to a two-story house directly below the ridge. After his words fall, the group sets off once again, crunching through the brush and down the tree-lined hill.</p>\n\n<p>We draw closer to the house. It&#39;s an old lady, wearing faded white paint. It looks nothing like the newer buildings in the city of Carit. A pre-war colonial farmhouse that survived the war in this isolated valley, far from the fighting in the city. Nearer now, I can appreciate how well it&#39;s built. Someone must be home, as there&#39;s faint grey smoke rising from its brick chimney. The light of the morning sun&#39;s catch the valley, peering out from the clouds, guiding us down the steep forested ridge.</p>\n\n<p>It feels good to be using gravity with my body, as opposed to against. We descend the ridge. As the terrain levels off below our feet, the trees begin to thin, and we clear the forest.</p>\n\n<p>We take a short jaunt across the field that separates the trees from the house. I smell the smoke from the wood-burning in the fireplace as we step onto the faded wooden porch. As the Tu and the soldiers collect on the landing, I turn back and gaze upon the forest, struck by the immense height of the trees and the vivid rolling landscape.</p>\n\n<p>The house creaks and groans as someone approaches the old front door from the inside. I&#39;m sure our presence was easily detected. I&#39;m guessing we were noticed long before we reached this weather-worn porch, maybe even as we were coming down the ridge. With some grumbling the old brown door of the farmhouse creaks open, we all turn to look.</p>\n\n<p>A woman emerges. She&#39;s wearing a buzz cut and a dark jacket. This is the same woman from the desert of Bowenn. Her face is cleaner but still weathered. Her skin is lighter but still cracked. The soldiers enter the house first. One quickly hugs the woman and enters the house. They appear much younger to me now, almost childlike.</p>\n\n<p>The Tu are much more skeptical, and mill about the porch for a moment, unsure if they should enter or not. I can sense their need, the injured Tu is blood-soaked, we are tired from the hike, but something in their Tu&#39;s brains doesn&#39;t want to barge in. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; Says the woman, as she moves from the threshold of the doorway, motioning us to enter.</p>\n\n<p>Once allowed, the group enters the old house at once as if moving as a single being. The main room is dark, with streaks of dust-filled light beaming through two sets of dirty, un-shuttered windows. There&#39;s a small fire going in the brick fireplace along the far wall near the staircase, emitting a faint glow.</p>\n\n<p>Noticing the injured Tu, the woman calls for the boys to get some medical supplies from the pantry. The group lays the wounded Tu upon a stained colonial style sofa near the center of the main room. After he is laid on the couch, one Tu begins to pray, while keeling and holding the hand of the injured creature.</p>\n\n<p>The boys return quickly with bandages and rush to the aid of the injured Tu. Reda Lokan steps into their path and blocks them with the large frame of his azure body.</p>\n\n<p>The boys squirm, attempting to get around him. &quot;What are you doing? I –he&#39;s–&quot;Reda grabs the arm of one boy.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don’t.&quot; He speaks slowly and clearly, holding the young soldiers back.</p>\n\n<p>I chime in. &quot;The blood–it&#39;s poisonous,&quot; I say toward the boys, walking toward them through the dim light.</p>\n\n<p>The boys and the woman both look at me as the commotion stops. Reda takes the supplies from the soldier&#39;s hand and offers it to the third Tu who has been standing beside the sofa. He walks to the other side of the furniture and begins to tend to his comrade. Reda lets go of the boys who lead us to the house. They watch as a skillful Tu removes the Kalila of his friend, exposing dark purple blood and torn blue skin. </p>\n\n<p>It must not be the first time these Tu have had to tend to each other&#39;s wounds. Their previous owner surely did not care for them, as made evident by his actions earlier. They would have found no treatment in the colonies either. Their blood is far too dangerous, and their lives too expandable to risk surgery. Tu can only rely on others of their kind for any sort of care, as such they&#39;ve become quite skilled at field medicine.</p>\n\n<p>I turn to the woman and notice her watching as well. She nods slowly to herself as if to assure herself this will turn out fine, this will be all worth it. She motions to the boys with an underhand sweeping gesture.</p>\n\n<p>The boys back away, as they are of no longer any use to the operation, and disappear into the house through the kitchen behind the main room.</p>\n\n<p>The woman turns to me, &quot;I&#39;m glad to see a familiar face around here. Still, I do not remember speaking with Malik of our operation.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m caught off guard, &quot;Ah...&quot; I purse my lips and pause while trying to plot out how to tell her the entire story, deciding if I even should.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No matter,&quot; she says, saving me without knowing. &quot;We can use all the help we can get.&quot; She pauses. &quot;Commander Kadina,&quot; she says, introducing herself. &quot;I didn&#39;t catch yours back on Bowenn.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She begins to walk towards the kitchen, and I follow her lead, maintaining the fledgling conversation as we walk. The soft prayer of the Tu chants as we walk.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal,&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So, Amal. You&#39;re here to join us, than?&quot; she asks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well. Not... exactly.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We enter the rustic kitchen off the main room. It&#39;s filled with golden light from the rising suns. A cabinet along the floor remains open from where the boys scavenged for medical supplies.</p>\n\n<p>She picks up the conversation, &quot;Not exactly? Then tell me, <em>what</em> exactly are you doing here?&quot; she asks as she leans slightly back onto the edge of the counter, and crosses her arms. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;You seemed in need of a gun,&quot; I say. Neglecting to reveal the weight of the actual situation, the fact I have six cycles left to find her leader and bring him alive to an imperial high officer in Port Bethany. Also, that terrible drink at the tavern.</p>\n\n<p>Kadina is not convinced. She uncrosses her arms and places her hands on her thighs as she stands up straight, leaning away from the counter.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Well—&quot;she says, as leaving a space in the conversation to decide what to say next but is interrupted by a Tu.</p>\n\n<p>Behind me, house moans and grumbles as Reda enters the kitchen. He stands for a moment, unsure if he was interrupting. He says nothing and greets Kadina with a standard Tu greeting. </p>\n\n<p>She nods and walks past. I follow her out of the kitchen. We pass the staircase to the left, and into the main room. The Tu have gathered. The injured one remains on the sofa, his shoulder clothed in a fresh bandage.</p>\n\n<p>Reda and Kadina begin speaking in Tukar, the native language of the Tu. It&#39;s a guttural-sounding language, filled with short monotone words. They converse for a moment. It is strange hearing this woman speaking Tukar. Her voice has a higher pitch, but the sergeant speaks it with fluid confidence. She murmurs short notes. Her voice is smooth and elegant compared to Reda.</p>\n\n<p>She stops speaking and the Tu, including Reda, slowly gather around her, making room in the circle for the injured Tu on the sofa. They stand taller than her in the dim light, fire crackling gently behind them.</p>\n\n<p>She turns and says a short phrase to the first Tu on her left. Her words are soft and spoken in what sounds like perfect Tukar. He responds and bows his head. She does the same for the next Tu. She kneels and speaks to the one laying. His response is soft and offers the same words, the same tone. She gets up, and turns to Reda Lokan, the leader of this group of Tu, and asks the same question, only to receive the same response.</p>\n\n<p>I turn to the staircase to notice one of the soldier boys coming down the stairs. She says something, and the group nods. The injured Tu is picked up, and the soldier guides the group down a dim hallway near the back of the main room.</p>\n\n<p>The floor creaks as they walk. The mood is solemn and quiet. Reda Lokan is the last to disappear down the hallway. He does, not before turning to nod to the sergeant and me.</p>\n\n<p>I left am alone with Kadina. &quot;What did you tell them?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They will join us. They swore an oath, to fight with the rebellion, to fight and win, or die trying. To renounce the empire and their rule.&quot; She says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What of the escape? It was all so you could recruit these creatures as soldiers? What about their freedom?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as <em>freedom</em>. Not with the empire dominating so much of the galaxy. Not with what they&#39;re doing to good and honest people. I have seen what they are capable of, and I know they will not stop.&quot; She responds, turning to me, and continues. &quot;Amal, we must all make sacrifices.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m left with my thoughts for a moment, amid the sound of a crackling fire, and the cold Kelesian wind whispering through this old farmhouse.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You promised them freedom. Not... servitude.&quot; I say after a long pause.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. Of course.&quot; She shakes her head as if I don&#39;t understand. &quot;And it will come.&quot; She continues. &quot;When the reign of the king comes to an end.&quot; She&#39;s unwavering in her commitment. &quot;Come,&quot; Kadina says, motioning us back to the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>I follow, and she offers me a seat at the old wooden table along the wall of the small kitchen. The table is worn from many lya of family gatherings, cycles upon cycles of the triple suns shining across the valley onto its earnest surface. I run my hand along the uneven surface and pick at a small dent with the tip of my finger.</p>\n\n<p>Kadina closes the cabinet the boys left open, picking up an opened tin of gauze, and tossing it into the back. She begins searching a cabinet above the counter. It creaks open like everything else in this old house. The woman removes spice jars and a good size woven bag of arza and sets them on the counter.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah. Here it is,&quot; Kadina says making a heartfelt discovery. She removes a familiar rectangular tin of <em>White Keesha</em>, a mid-grade, strip-cut tea. I recognize it because it&#39;s commonly available both on and off the seven colonies. She replaces the spices and the bag of grains she removed during the search, and with a kettle already on the range, begins to prepare the tea.</p>\n\n<p>With a lit match, the range ignites with a hiss and a pop. Blue flames lick the kettle from below. It begins to warm. Steam vapors dance in the light of the three suns. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m transporting the blues up the valley to Kethar to start their training.&quot; She says while fetching a traditional teacup from the small cabinet above the sink. </p>\n\n<p>The cup and lid are plain colored, but together they form the distinctive traditional imperial tea setup. The cups are short and symmetrical, with a pouting lip. As a set, there is a lid that can be used to both holds back loose leaves, and swirl the tea as it brews. This method of brewing a single cup of tea in Athylian is known as <em>buresh</em>. Traditionally, the process involves rinsing the cup with hot water to both warm and clean the cup. After a hot rinse, leaves are added, the amount depends on the cut of leave used. After a rinse and the leaves have been added, the cup is filled to the brim with steaming hot water. The lid is placed on, and the tea is then allowed to steep.</p>\n\n<p>Buresh is simpler than <em>bochah</em>, and is used when effort is intended to be minimal. Bochah is the traditional means of thinking about tea, and is seen by some as the civilized way to drink. With bochah it is often expected that you perform a more formal tea ceremony, where the setup of both the utensils and tea area are taken into consideration. Bochah is often the preferred way to drink with noble Athylian guests. It is common to offer bochah to guests who are visiting important cities in New Athylia.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Is —&quot; I ask as she walks out of the kitchen. I want to ask about Resnick and if he&#39;ll be there. If I can take him prisoner and against his will bring him before the Athylian empire at Port Bethany. I want to ask much of her people, the rebellion. I decide it&#39;s best not to give anything away, I need to find him, but without anyone knowing.</p>\n\n<p>I settle for, &quot;How far is it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We <em>should</em> get there before the third sun sets.&quot; She responds, half-yelling from the other room. I glance at the kettle. It&#39;s steaming well. When she returns, she&#39;s carrying a small confederate style rucksack. &quot;But you never know.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nod. Kadina collects things around the kitchen, including imperial military rations, and packs them in her bag. She flicks off the flame on the range. With a quick, skillful motion, she adds two heaping spoonfuls of dried leaves to the empty cup. The smell of herbs and tea fill the kitchen as she pours the steaming liquid into my cup. She places the lid on the cup. It floats as a pocket of air is trapped under the concave lid. Kadina swirls the leaves in the cup with the lid and slides it to me across the worn table. The aroma is herbal. The smell mixes with the musk of the old house.</p>\n\n<p>It is at this moment, while the tea is infusing the water, tradition holds taking a moment to reflect and pray. Religious Athylians take this act seriously, and the custom has since spread throughout much of the empire. Out of habit, I let my mind stray. In my thoughts, I speak to the kitchen. How many cups have been served in this old place? How many arguments have been won, or lost over a cup of hot tea? How many good times savored, and bad times ignored? Tell me, what have you seen old girl?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interrupted. &quot;If you&#39;re planning on sticking around, my boys are making a supply run later this cycle. They can take you back to the city.&quot; She says, shrugging &quot;Also... They seem to like you.&quot; She tosses me a half-smile then turns solemn. She picks up her dark leather bag to head out.</p>\n\n<p>The moment to reflect ends, and I dive into slurping and sipping the steaming hot psychotropic tea. It&#39;s botanic and earthy. There&#39;s a vegetal component, with bold tannins and mild acid. She brewed it strong. I can feel my muscles loosening. </p>\n\n<p>A calmness arrives.</p>\n\n<p>Throwing the bag over her shoulder, the contents shifts, it clatters. &quot;If not, as I said, we need all the help we can get. You should think about heading up to Kethar.&quot; She does a quick check of the room and finishes her thought. &quot;If you&#39;re interested, that is.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interested in getting out of this mess. I make no mention of it to the commander. If Resnick is in fact at Kethar, and I am going to be escorting him to The Orylia system, I&#39;ll need my ship nearby. Getting back to <em>Opportune</em> is my next move. I&#39;ll go back to the city with the boys.</p>\n\n<p>Commander Kadina leaves through the front door. The old farmhouse sighs in relief when she steps off the porch. For a moment I hear the birds outside louder than ever. Although I can&#39;t see it, I overhear the engines of her transport spooling up. I imagine the Tu onboard, some wounded, some scared, all paying the cost of starting a new life.</p>\n\n<p>The transport&#39;s engines reach full power, and their sound fades into the distance. Not unlike myself. The potent brew fades me into the morning. I continue to sip the tea. The flavors have opened up. It&#39;s cooled off a bit. I find the dent in the old table I was touching previously, and my mind wanders as the tea sets in. The sounds of the birds once again fill the room. I sit at the table, my finger resting on one of its scars, and I close my eyes.</p>\n\n<p>I feel a gentle tugging on my pant leg. My eyes open. When I open them, the room is different. I do not know how, but the walls have changed to match the decor from several hundred years ago. I stare at the wood, commanding it to return, feeling foolish as I attempt to control the very universe. The warped wood does not listen.</p>\n\n<p>A small Tu child with sky-blue skin and wide eyes has his hand on the leg of my pants from under the table. He&#39;s playful, soft. He tugs at my leg once more and crawls back under the table. He&#39;s teasing, beckoning me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I check under the table to get a better look at the child. He slips out of view and into the main room. I chase after him, my feet are light, and my footsteps&nbsp;muted. The old farmhouse is empty. I peer through the dirty window of the main room and see the child near a broadleaf tree in the meadow near the house. As soon as I spot him, he runs toward the forest.</p>\n\n<p>I burst out of the house, light on my feet, running after the child. I can hear him laughing at the sound of the wind through the grass and the birds in the trees — everything echos. Everything glows. The three suns shine above. As I fly through a meadow in Lilia hollow, chasing him, running, I leave the creaky old house behind.</p>\n\n<p>He breaks the tree line and disappears into the forest. I&#39;m only steps behind him. I stop once entering the trees, breathing heavily and trying to see what direction he&#39;s gone. The trees are tall, and the shade of the forest is cool on my skin. I brush my hair out of my vision, and spot the child ahead, near a well-lit clearing below the tall trees. He laughs, signaling me with his hands.</p>\n\n<p>I again take off after him. This time, he isn&#39;t running. He&#39;s stopped in the clearing as if waiting for me to catch him. Breaking branches and pushing through the foliage, I rush forward. The child stands fast in the clearing. I&#39;m winded when I reach him.</p>\n\n<p>Exhausted, I&#39;m standing out of arm&#39;s reach of the child. I reach out and walk towards him, my arm outstretched. Behind me, I hear animals howling and growling. I turn to look. The sound continues, followed by the sound of branches shattering. I turn back to run, expecting to see the child, but a coyote stands where he once was. Instinctively, I know this is what I&#39;ve been chasing, just in another form. He bolts away, faster than ever.</p>\n\n<p>The sounds behind me grow louder, and I chase the boy once again. We&#39;re moving at an incredible speed. Trees are whirling by, green and brown blurs. I can&#39;t outrun the sound behind me, nor can I catch the boy who has transformed. As I give chase, the trees fade away, we break out the of the forest, and into a dune-filled desert. I&#39;m back on Bowenn. </p>\n\n<p>As he runs, his paws kick up dust and debris. The dust is too much. I fall to my knees, choking. I battle the sand and grit clearing my eyes. Still, on my knees, the dust settles, and I look up. We&#39;re standing on the precipice of an immense gorge. On the other side, I can see shrubland, with small plants scattered across the landscape. The wind howls and the grey and white coyote paces back and forth at the edge of a high cliff.</p>\n\n<p>I rise from my knees buried in the sand. Standing, I turn away from the cliff and face a snarling pack of wild coyotes. They are slowly approaching, I back away, weary of the cliffs and the boy behind me.</p>\n\n<p>The ground begins to shake and tremble. Voices, I hear voices from high above. The ground trembles, and a terrible sound fills the sky. The wild pack of coyotes runs and scatters, as I fall onto my back, gazing into the orange, purple sky.</p>\n\n<p>A shadow falls over me, and the voices rise. An imperial brigantine roars and floats above the sand, blotting out the suns. It&#39;s thunderous, blowing dust in all directions. I look for the boy for what I was chasing. And shout with all my strength, but the ground is giving way. The land is giving way, cracking. I begin to fall through the erupting landscape. I slip away from the imperial ship and the sky. I&#39;m falling with sand and rocks into the nothingness – and the voices are getting more precise, louder.</p>\n\n<p>Then there was nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I open my eyes and find myself seated at the kitchen table of the farmhouse. The decor has returned to normal. Golden sun pouring in through the windows. The air is silent and dusted, as it&#39;s been for many lya. One of the soldier boys is standing on the opposite end of the room, near the cabinet he raided earlier. The young soldier is dressed in plain-looking clothes and is without his rifle.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Captain... Captain,&quot; He says. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; He asks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; I&#39;m still dazed from the hectic dream. I scratch the back of my neck and look at the half-empty cup of tea sitting on the table. I shake it off.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time, I notice his actual age. He looks to be a young man of eight lya. The age when people take their first steps into adulthood. Old enough to be on his own, young enough to not.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My brother and I are leaving for the city – are you coming with us?&quot;. His voice is much more childlike than when we were in the boat.</p>\n\n<p>I say, blinking hard and swallowing once. &quot;Of course. Of course. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>15</h1>\n\n<p>Weary from the dream, I leave the Kelesian farmhouse with the two solider boys. Is the tea still in my system? I can&#39;t tell. I feel light but grounded enough to keep up.</p>\n\n<p>Outside, insects in the meadow chirp. Wild birds warble in the trees. Ahead of me is the oldest of the young men, carrying a brown bag on his shoulder – the same one as the night before. Following behind us is the younger of the two. The oldest leads us to a narrow but long wooden shed not far from the house.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m Owen.&quot; The leader says while looking back at me and adjusting his bag. &quot;That&#39;s my brother, Cordell.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal,&quot; I say, following them through the high grass near the shed. Its full-width door is open a peek. At its feet the ground is worn, and dirt is exposed. It&#39;s well-used structure, half-shaded from a nearby old tree.</p>\n\n<p>Owen is the first to reach the door. Leaning and using the weight of his body, he slides it open. It grinds and scrapes as it moves. Inside the shed, there are no windows, only small gaps in the wooden siding letting narrow beams of light sneak through. The middle of the shed holds an early model tandem skiff.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Here is our ride.&quot; He says with pride. It must be his.</p>\n\n<p>The skiff is of an old elegant design. A single round headlight is mounted flush against its long smooth front. Under the metal and vents of the front fuselage, lay the engine. The black piped guts are installed under a curved hood that forms a long-drawn upside-down &quot;U&quot; shape. Behind the front engine compartment is the windshield, dash, seats, and controls. The tail of the craft ends abruptly with a small swooping hatch directly behind the two headrests of the seats.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I thought that we would be departing by boat?&quot; I wonder aloud, peering through the old dust of the shed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is <em>way</em> faster. Trust me.&quot; He says. He&#39;s got a look in his eye. I wonder, should I be afraid or excited?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s safe.&quot; Cordell pipes up as if reading my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Owen reaches around the windshield with his and clicks a switch. He steps back. The headlight blinks to life, then the skiff and emits a high pitch charging sound before sputtering and kicking up off the ground. A puff of white smoke sputters from the vents in the front section. Once it&#39;s stable and the exhaust has cleared, he leans in and checks the reactant level on the analog instrument cluster.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;More than enough.&quot; He says lowly. Owen places his pack in a wedge-shaped storage area behind the single row of seats.</p>\n\n<p>We stand back, and he alone pushes the thing out of the shed. It glides effortlessly, floating above the ground while emitting a low humming sound. Cordell closes the old doors behind us, neglecting to latch it shut.</p>\n\n<p>The three of us are standing beside a hovering skiff at the foot of the meadow. &quot;Cord, you get the middle seat &#39;cause you&#39;re the smallest.&quot; Owen says to both of us, and continues, &quot;Cap- I mean Amal, you hop in first.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Approaching the skiff, I notice it&#39;s larger and older than the ones I saw on Bowenn, and with a semi-open cockpit. The skids double as a step-up to board. I hop onto the skid, and the skiff compensates by groaning a bit while rebalancing itself. I climb in and get settled in the far right seat. The open cockpit has two dark grey main seats, and a smaller area to sit between them. Each position has an identical set of knobs, controls, and foot pedals.</p>\n\n<p>I slide over to the right seat and admire the simple cluster of old-style gauges. I&#39;m careful not to touch anything as Cordell hops on board. The skiff once again compensates for the weight by groaning and leveling back off. Cordell plops next to me. We&#39;re touching arms.<br/></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Acho.&quot; he says, speaking an informal Athylian greeting.</p>\n\n<p>In one motion Owen hops up and closes the small half door on the left side of the cockpit.</p>\n\n<p>He turns to us. &quot;Everyone ready?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Without waiting for an answer, he hits the accelerator. We explode with speed into the meadow, the acceleration and pins me to my seat. I search for a harness, and I&#39;m not surprised there isn&#39;t one. The pulse engine rips alive and winds up to full power as Owen presses the accelerator further with his foot. I watch the gauges come to life, and feel the wind whip through my hair after being deflected by the small but practical windshield.</p>\n\n<p>He cuts right, banking the craft through the turn. We fly past the farmhouse. One more turn and we&#39;re headed down the middle of the valley. In the distance is an old water tower. A handful of houses scatter the farmland. As the valley widens, we encounter old craters pocking the landscape. Overgrown with grasses and vegetation, these shallow craters are fading reminders of a war long past.</p>\n\n<p>A dark cracked road cuts across the valley ahead. We stop before crossing its threshold. This is the first time we&#39;ve stopped since we&#39;ve blasted away from the house and the old shed. I take this opportunity to readjust in my seat and look at Cordell. He&#39;s checking the intersection for other traffic, his eyes looking past a black and white sign. It reads &quot;Lillian No. 81-90&quot; in Athylian block lettering. We turn to make a smooth left onto the road, and the acceleration pins me once more.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How far is it to the port?&quot; I ask not directly at either of the brothers, floating the question into the windy air.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Shouldn&#39;t be too long once we get into the city,&quot; Owen says loudly over the noise of the wind. We pass a burned out and rusted Imperial battle tank left to rot in an arza field. &quot;But we have to make a quick stop before.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I motion a slow nod, contemplating the itinerary of the trip, and lose my train of thought gazing into the fields of green and white against the hazy mountain backdrop. With few trees, they valley contrasts what I remember while entering the atmosphere and flying over endless forests before landing. What was these boys&#39; life was like growing up in such a lush planet, so full of life, so full of hope? Young men with a bright future on of the most promising colonies under the empire.</p>\n\n<p>The road turns steep. It begins to twist and wind through a sloping forest. The light of the suns blinks a random pattern of dappled light onto our faces and the grey, graveled road. We pass a hooded figure riding a Great Horned Mayyan on our left. He and his beast turn to watch us. We slow a bit. The old animal has had its horns shaved into stubby white cylinders protruding from it&#39;s dark, lean head. This is standard practice for these enormous creatures, especially when they used to work fields or for transportation.</p>\n\n<p>We increase speed after passing the pair. As if prompted by the sight of such a creature, Cordell pipes up with a question. &quot;So, how do you know so much about Tu?&quot; He asks, remembering my reaction to the bleeding Tu, and how I knew of the poison in their blood.</p>\n\n<p>I think for a moment. It&#39;s true. I know a lot about Tu. I find them fascinating, complex. One of my oldest and most trusted friends is one – Malik. I think back to the first time I ever met a Tu. It was long ago, aboard a transport from Tau Ogma to the planet below. The old ship was practically falling apart, it smelled like mold and stale ozone, and the gravity generator was shot. The craft was packed with people from all over the galaxy; one of them was a free woman, a Tu. At first, I thought she had a disease. Perhaps the regolith of Tau Ogma turned her skin a brilliant blue with white freckles. It wasn&#39;t until much later I learned she, and people like her were from Tukar, and they evolved over millions of years to have blue skin, and poison blood.</p>\n\n<p>I turn to Cordell, &quot;Some of my good friends are Tu.&quot; I say over the wind rush. &quot;I&#39;ve known them my whole life.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You have <em>Tu friends</em>?&quot; He responds with surprise in his voice. Was it that odd? I suppose to those in the colonies it&#39;s strange to be friends with a Mayyan, or a Spig. These creatures were simply tools.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s not unusual, Cord,&quot; Owen says, trying to be the older, wiser brother while keeping his eyes on the narrowing road ahead.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ve never met a free one.&quot; Cordell says, trailing off until picking back up and saying &quot;– but Kadina says they will all be free one day.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kandia.&quot; I pause, glancing at both of them. &quot;Is she your mother?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Owen laughs and Cordell busts while giggling and say, &quot;Our Anaa?&quot; He slips in the Athylian word for mother. He is shaking his head. &quot;No. Way.&quot; The boys seem offended playfully.</p>\n\n<p>Owen jumps into the conversation &quot;She looks after us, but she&#39;s <em>not</em> our mother.&quot; He pauses for a second to slow down to take a sharp turn. A sleek craft whizzes by us as we turn, it&#39;s pulse engine is smooth and fast. I listen to it rev as it powers down the hill and fades away.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We help watch the house –&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lilia House&quot; Cordell proudly interjects.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lilia House,&quot; Owen repeats, taking back the conversation, &quot;–and we help out where we can when Kay needs us – like last night.&quot; He pauses, and continues, &quot;But this isn&#39;t it for us, you know? One day we&#39;re going to be on our own, and we&#39;re going to go up north with the rest.&quot; He explains. &quot;Anyway, It&#39;s a safe place for them. For a cycle or two and then it&#39;s off to Carios or wherever until they can make it&nbsp;up to Nora.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I see,&quot; I say, embracing the silence, waiting for more information, watching the trees slide past.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Kay says even General Resnick knows about us. He&#39;s a great general.&quot; Cordell says after a moment. &quot;He&#39;s going to free all the Tu one day, and then fight the empire, and we&#39;re going to help.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Resnick–&quot;Just saying his name makes me anxious. &quot;Is he with the Tu? In Kethar?&quot; I ask, trying not to sound over-eager.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yup. Kay says we can meet him one day – when we&#39;re old enough.&quot; Cordell says with pride and hope.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I might even go next lya,&quot; Owen says. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Owen, you always say that!&quot; Cordell responds as he pushes his brother in the shoulder. The craft swerves left. Owen corrects the wavering course.</p>\n\n<p>I like these boys. They remind me of a family I never had. They&#39;re young, playful, but also independent. </p>\n\n<p>We crest a hill and begin a long descent into the next valley. I think for a moment of Resnick and Kethar, trying to formulate a plan. If I&#39;m going to get Resnick, I&#39;ll need to get back to <em>Opportune</em> first, then head to Kethar.</p>\n\n<p>The boys and I ride for a short while after descending the next valley. Here, there are more signs of civilization. People are about, and there are small, low houses every so often with driveways, fences, trees in their yards. Ahead are the gates to the city of Carit.</p>\n\n<p>We are stopped at the checkpoint by a stocky imperial sentry. He wears a red band embellished white shield on his upper arm. A signal he is colonial police, ever ready to dispense royal justice. When challenged at the checkpoint, Owen is honest. &quot;Port drop-off.&quot; He says. I lean forward past Cordell and make my presence known.</p>\n\n<p>Through a thick mustache, he warns us. &quot;Been some trouble over there ma&#39;am.&quot; The guard says. &quot;Best to not linger there too long. Anything out of sorts should be reported to the dockmaster. Understood?&quot; He finishes and looks us all over.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course. Thank you.&quot; I said cooly, knowing exactly what happened.</p>\n\n<p>The imperial guard waves us through the already open gates. They rarely close anymore. These gates and this wall were built during the war by the confederation. Ironically, these walls were intended to keep out the very same people who are waving us through.</p>\n\n<p>We pass the checkpoint and enter the city proper. Most people live within the boundaries of the city&#39;s wall. It stands about twice the height of the average person and encircles the entire city. This old wall marks the original bounds of the settlement.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Almost there. We’re making a slight detour.&quot; Owen says, turning off the main road and down a narrow street. We enter a small residential district. It seems quiet – nobody&#39;s on the streets. In the vicinity are several blocks of low brick row houses. Some corners have small nondescript shops with gated windows and closed doors. One house has boarded windows, and it&#39;s once red brick walls stained black with soot from a recent fire.</p>\n\n<p>One more turn and we&#39;re down a street between a row of narrow houses and an empty lot. The skiff purrs and comes to a stop near the middle of the block, facing one of the tightly packed brick houses. The area opposite the row of houses is empty and fenced off. Beyond the fence, there&#39;s garbage strewn about what looks to be the burned-out foundation of a structure.</p>\n\n<p>The skiff sets down as Owen shuts the power off. Once settled, he&#39;s the first to hop out, followed by Cordell. I&#39;m left in the far seat. The engine ticks as it cools. As I&#39;m preparing to leave, he stops me. &quot;We&#39;ll only be a minute.&quot; He says, grabbing his small brown bag from behind the seats. I nod an acknowledgment, tossing a half-wave from inside the skiff.</p>\n\n<p>Young Owen sprints up the short stoop connecting the door of the house to the sidewalk. Cordell follows. Before reaching the door, it cracks open to a black sliver. Someone appears in the unlit doorway, and the two boys slip inside.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like the feeling of this place. Alone in the skiff, I try to settle back and adjust my jacket. Hopefully, they won&#39;t be long. From down the alley, a white vehicle makes a lazy turn towards me. It&#39;s a dirty imperial police cruiser on patrol. Squarish, with a scarlet stripe, it leisures down the narrow path between the row of houses and the burned ruins.</p>\n\n<p>I sink lower into my seat, attempting to hide. I get the sense this is a problem neighborhood for the empire, and whatever must be going on in the house, is the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The cruiser slows to inspect the skiff. I lay still in the seat. For whatever reason, the vehicle doesn&#39;t stop at the house. It continues down the alley, smoothy proceeding to the next block.</p>\n\n<p>The faint sound of sirens the distance awakens the cruiser from its sleepwalk. It speeds away, disappearing with a left turn. I raise my body to have a look, using my arms and lifting off the seat. My head swivels while keeping down. No movement. No one on the streets. An empty alley in this old ghetto.</p>\n\n<p>Gathering myself, I slide left exiting the skiff. Stepping off the craft, the ground is closer than I expected. This area is desolate. Several blocks of disparaging homes surround me. A borough that flourished before the war, it never came back to life. </p>\n\n<p>Moving closer to where the boys disappeared, I notice the house next door. It&#39;s a meager brick structure. The lower windows are lifted open letting in the chilled air. My ears pick up a radio news program from inside the house — a sign of life in on this cold, empty street.</p>\n\n<p>Approaching the steps, the door opens.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You with them?&quot; a hoarse voice croaks in the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am,&quot; I say, trying to see his face.</p>\n\n<p>The door opens slightly wider — a signal to enter. I go in.</p>\n\n<p>This house has no electricity. It smells rotten like mildew and vomit. The walls, once covered in a fine decorative wallpaper, are stained brown and black. The air is thick. I choke and cough. My lungs were ill-prepared for the shock of whatever defiled this place.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ugh,&quot; I said aloud.</p>\n\n<p>The front room curtains are drawn, blocking all light from outside. Amid the darkness, stench, and fragments of light, three people sit in ragged clothes on shabby furniture. The room is disheveled. Garbage and soiled dishware lay strewed about. The people, a woman, and two men lay in a mist of fine greenish vapor, fuming from a small metal pot on a low wooden table.</p>\n\n<p>A thin woman in the front room is laying on a small mattress. She turns her head to me and gazes blankly. It&#39;s as if part of her knows I&#39;m here, but the other part can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m real or not. Her bare breast is exposed and her head nods on the bed continuously as if trying to remember something.</p>\n\n<p>Fume houses. These places are where the worst of the worst are brought to use. They&#39;re designed to take people away from the pain of life, to cleanse their misery with a fog-filled trip. But the price is always too high. Illegal, but it&#39;s never policed. The police can&#39;t do anything about it. They don&#39;t want the addicts back on the streets. So they look the other way.</p>\n\n<p>The woman sits up on the mattress. Her eyebrows pull together, and she frowns at me. Her red hair is matted and her face is pale. She adjusts her clothing and wipes her mouth with the back of her hands.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Shut the door! Hey, shut the fuckin&#39; door!&quot; she yells. &quot;We&#39;re still fuckin&#39; hot. Shut the door!&quot; She&#39;s talking wildly, shaking, and twitching. Scourge. She&#39;s been using too much tea extract. It&#39;s kept her high, but it&#39;s also taking her to a dangerous place.</p>\n\n<p>The doorman closes the old door. The house darkens with the absence of any real sunlight. The green mist of vapor thickens. The two men appear to be unconscious, but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re in that place between sleep and waking — where the lines between here and the dream world are blurred. Where the mind is free to play with the images in its imagination, where there are no time constraints, where nothing has shape and nothing is real.</p>\n\n<p>In the faintest of light, she withering woman looks at me again. Her eyes are glazed from the Scourge and she leans forward as if trying to focus. She frowns at me, then turns to cough. A skinny shirtless man with long black hair sits in the chair next to the bed. He rubs her back, trying to ease her pain. The toxins have wracked her body, and her breathing is labored. She coughs again and then lets out a long sigh before laying back onto her bed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Is it good? Is it good?&quot; she asks him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s good, it&#39;s really good,&quot; he says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t feel my legs,&quot; she says, trying to move them. She doesn&#39;t seemed alarmed by this. She just seems to be reporting an observation.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;ll pass. You&#39;ll be good,&quot; he says.</p>\n\n<p>I look up at the doorman. His eyes are cast down. He&#39;s ashamed. I&#39;m ashamed for him. &quot;You want some dust while?... &quot;He scratched the back of his head while losing his train of thought. &quot;– what was your name again?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Where&#39;s Owen?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Upstairs.&quot; He says motioning to the wooden staircase to my left.</p>\n\n<p>The doorman ambles to the front room, returning to his vapors. I&#39;m left alone looking at the landing and the staircase.</p>\n\n<p>Halfway up the dilapidated stairs, I hear Owen. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;–shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot; He says, finishing a sentence while talking to a dark figure.</p>\n\n<p>I round the top of the staircase and turn right to see Cord, Owen and a tall, lanky man. He&#39;s wearing dark clothes and a cowl folded down. They all turn to look at me. Owen and Cord are startled.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; The scrawny man&#39;s voice is much more precise than the croaking doorman.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A friend,&quot; Owen says, thinking quick.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re with the imperial watch than?&quot; He says. &quot;Here to do what exactly?&quot; He&#39;s pegged me as the police. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;She’s a friend. I&#39;m telling you.&quot; Owen pleads.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amal,&quot; I say putting my hands out flat and motioning downward. &quot;I am not imperial. Just getting a, ride friend.&quot; I try to improvise, pulling from my repertoire of frontier-smuggling-gone-wrong skills.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like this. Not at all. You bringing this woman here.&quot; The man says with disgust. He flips his hood over his head and walks toward the staircase.</p>\n\n<p>Passing me, he whispers &quot;Hawaa,&quot; a sexist insult in Athylian. Nearer, he pushes me. Delivering a firm shoulder-to-shoulder shove, I&#39;m not phased. I could drop him in a heartbeat. I feel bad for him, a deadbeat kid, dealing in the slums. </p>\n\n<p>Once the man leaves, Owen speaks up in a yelling whisper. &quot;Amal. What are you doing?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Patrol passed by – I didn&#39;t want to have to explain.&quot; I stop for a second. Before &quot;What were two were doing up here?&quot; I ask. &quot;What was that?&quot; I&#39;m whisper-yelling back while pointing to where the man exited.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What does it look like?&quot; Owen retorts and continues. &quot;We&#39;ve got to make money somehow.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Peddling bad tea?&quot; I accuse.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re no better.&quot; He stammers. &quot;Kay told us <em>all about it</em> while you were asleep. Don&#39;t act like you&#39;re innocent.&quot; Owen finishes. Cordell looks at us both, still stunned.</p>\n\n<p>With a sigh, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; he says. &quot;Come on Cord.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We proceed down the staircase and back to the dingy bottom floor. From the landing of the stairs, I peek into the dark front room. The doorman is emptying a metal tin into an ashtray. Focusing hard and scraping it clean with a small spoon. Through the haze, he doesn&#39;t notice us leave. The bony woman is still lying upon a shabby cushion. Her gaunt face illuminates with the opening of the front door and disappears back into the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>Fresh air. It&#39;s crisp and cool outside. From the stoop of the house, we face the empty lot strewn with garbage. Walking quickly ahead of us, Owen is the first to get to the skiff. He reaches in and powers it up. It coughs one time, puffing thin smoke. By the time Cord and I reach the vehicle, it&#39;s powered up and hovering.</p>\n\n<p>Silence. I&#39;m the first to get in. Following me is Cordell then Owen. Once we&#39;re all in and seated, Owen backs us off the curb. We travel for a bit in the direction of the main road and the checkpoint. Once at the road we entered the city by, we turn away from the gate and travel deeper into the city.</p>\n\n<p>I break the silence with an apology. &quot;Forgive me, Owen,&quot; I say, talking through Cordell in the middle seat. &quot;Should have stayed outside.&quot; I continue.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is what it is.&quot; Owen says. &quot;At least you didn&#39;t draw your gun on him.&quot; He continues, turning the skiff down a hilly house-lined street. After coordinating the turn, Owen continues &quot;Kay also told us about that too.&quot; referring to <em>&nbsp;Reason to Believe</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Cordell&#39;s eyes open wide, recalling whatever story Kadina told he and his brother.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; I say. &quot;<em>That</em>&quot;, wondering how Kadina became familiar with my sidearm. I&#39;m curious if she knows the stories it holds. They may have met before, although unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps Malik regaled her with tales of a legendary weapon, and it&#39;s owner – myself, a woman of &quot;mystique.&quot; His words, not mine.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to Cord, the boy is racked with the curiosity of the legend. We sit in silence for a moment. I let the boy&#39;s curiosity build until it&#39;s unbearable.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It was an heirloom...&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<h1>16</h1>\n\n<p>It&#39;s midday when the boys leave me at the starport. Their skiff speeds off to the city. I toss a wave.</p>\n\n<p>The early winter day has warmed a bit, with two of the three suns high in the pale Kelesian sky.</p>\n\n<p>I turn my attention to the port, and it&#39;s as busy as when I arrived what seems like ages ago even though it was only yesterday. As if the port were a stage, a performance I&#39;ve already seen plays out again. People from far and wide rush about with their luggage or haul goods of every kind to and from long cargo ships. It is chaotic, but everyone knows their part. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike yesterday, there&#39;s a more substantial imperial presence. I pass three well-armed and alert guards at the main entrance to the open-air anchorage. They scan the undulating crowd. Rifles slug, they watch the curb where I was dropped off like many travelers. I feel uneasy, but play it off walking into the bustling imperial zone with confidence. They pay me no mind.</p>\n\n<p>I see others walk by in the distance, and my eyes follow. I note particular stares that seem to linger. I wonder if any of these new faces are here checking me out, the stranger who arrived yesterday, the trigger-happy woman with a big pistol. I feel confident I&#39;m not being followed or stalked.</p>\n\n<p>The imperial landing zone is the exact inverse of the rest of the port. While merchants and customers crowd the docking area, its vessels&#39; ramps stay as clear as possible. In fact, security forces seem to be stationed every few meters along the imperial zone&#39;s entire perimeter. Their presence today is heavier than when I arrived yesterday. I pass several of them who are armed with rifles and intimidating the crowd near the imperial zone&#39;s checkpoint.</p>\n\n<p>As I follow a young man pushing a cart of crates, I notice a familiar looking ship. Parked crooked between a couple of old sludge haulers is a craft that looks remarkably like <em>Normandie Place</em>. It&#39;s the same model and just as beat up. My heart skips a beat. Did Dusty follow me here? Had what they said been true? It occurs to me they could have paid him to tail me. I slow my pace and look for a sign to prove myself wrong. While paused, a creature with a long neck and wide-body grumbles behind me. I&#39;ve blocked the path, and it has to sidestep my body.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; I say, bewitched by the <em>Normandie Place</em> look-alike.</p>\n\n<p>The alien rider waves me off with a chunky, three-clawed hand, before straddling its mount.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Move it,&quot; a voice sounds off behind me. I remember that I&#39;m standing in the middle of the little walkway, and I move aside to let the bustling crowd squeeze by.</p>\n\n<p>Once my eyes fixate again on the ship in question. Relived, I realize it&#39;s not Dusty&#39;s when I catch a wooly creature standing by the struts staring at me. He&#39;s armed, and no doubt wondering what this strange person is doing approaching his ship. Hopefully, he thinks I&#39;m merely lost. I stop for a moment and act as though I&#39;m admiring his craft. Glancing up toward the well seasoned hull, faded letters read <em>Medway Prize</em>. The wooly thing hasn&#39;t moved, nor has it taken its golden eyes off me. I back away and return to the path with a newly acquired sense of awareness. </p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> sits as I left her. And across from her is the new freighter that has recently lost its owner. It&#39;s been cordoned off with ropes and poles. A posted sign identifies the crime scene. I guess that the ship has been reclaimed, in the name of the king of course, and is now imperial property. Is she set to be resold? Or maybe she&#39;ll be bestowed upon a royal family member as a gift.</p>\n\n<p>Attached to the landing strut of my ship, near the access panel, is a note. It bears the seal of the royal police. I don&#39;t spend much time reading it. Something about my involvement in a recent incident and orders to report to a building in the city. They don&#39;t want me leaving, but I&#39;ve got other plans.</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> is as ready and willing to fly as I am. I quickly work through the startup sequence. She powers up smoothly. Various systems come online one by one, although I&#39;m only half paying attention. While my hands work the varied panels, images of the group of Tu appear in my mind. They&#39;re well on their way to Cordellia. But was it worth the risk? Was I reckless or too brash getting involved? Malik may have been right, we all will pick a side, and maybe this was my time to do so. The wheels have been set into motion. There&#39;s no going back now.</p>\n\n<p>With a final inspection and a &quot;go&quot; from the automated systems, I disengage the docking clamps. I test a few controls and power systems. All is well. I glance to the side and see an antiquated sludge hauler <em>Wonderer</em> making ready to depart, brown sludge slung low in her open hold.</p>\n\n<p>I push her throttle forward. My ship rumbles, hungering for the sky.</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> clears the starport and shipyard&#39;s security nearly as quickly as she cleared the takeoff pad. <em>Wonderer</em>, takes it steady although her ascent seems a bit crooked. <em>Opportune</em> hums beneath me. The engines roar, complaining of the sustained burn, but she puts on a great show.</p>\n\n<p>I pull back on the throttle and set a course for the mountains it&#39;s a beautiful day for flying. A flock of birds whistles by, and for a moment, I follow them. They&#39;re happy, and at home. It puts my mind at ease. I catch sight of <em>Wonderer</em> leaving the bounds of the port.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;ll make it. Good.</p>\n\n<p>I quickly scan the starport. Focusing on the imperial zone. Security is on the move. They&#39;ll be after us soon. One of the officers on a hover skiff waves some kind of device, signaling the others. I punch the throttle and cut a swath through the sky. The extra power feels good.</p>\n\n<p>Under <em>Opportune</em>&#39;s heavy hull, the starport shrinks to a blip. On the horizon, the shadows of the mountains are beginning to grow over the flat landscape. The sky broadens as the land narrows. The engines roar and change pitch. A rich, deep vibration in the back of my head. She&#39;s beginning to pick up speed. I glance to the side and notice a speck gaining on us.</p>\n\n<p>An imperial police craft is tailing me. It&#39;s an interceptor, a small, streamlined, and armed vessel. Of course, I&#39;m being tracked. They must have been tracking me for a while. How? I didn&#39;t notice anything unusual. I&#39;m not sure how much time I have until they fire on me. I can&#39;t take the chance. I have to change my trajectory</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> picks up more speed. I watch the ground fall away. I glance back again. The interceptor is keeping a steady pace. My ship&#39;s engines groan. Although we&#39;re more than a match for the speed of <em>Wonderer</em>, the imperial vessel brings a challenge. For the first time I&#39;m nervous. Relax, I tell myself. I feel a roll coming on and tighten my harness. <em>Opportune</em> weaves about in the sky. She fights me, but I know she can handle it. The interceptor tries to match me flight for flight. &quot;We&#39;re out-flying them. I think.&quot; I mutter, mostly for my benefit. </p>\n\n<p>The interceptor is still with us, but they&#39;re losing ground. They have to know that they&#39;re losing this chase, what will they do?</p>\n\n<p>I roll <em>Opportune</em> to the right to avoid an inbound starship, only to meet with a crackling burst of a high energy beam. I react instantly shifting my controls, <em>Opportune</em> dips to the right, letting the beam pass overhead. I hear the imperial craft firing again, but it&#39;s wide. They trying to scare me, but I&#39;m not falling for it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Opportune</em> banks, her twin engines whine. I glanced back, I can see what&#39;s happening under her belly. The interceptor is losing altitude, they won&#39;t be able to catch me. The third shot isn&#39;t at my ship, however. Instead, the beam cuts through <em>Wonderer</em>. The sludge hauler isn&#39;t quick enough to veer out of the way and the energy beam emits sparks and flames from her hull on contact. She careens through the sky like a skipping stone, and stumbles out of the sky.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a tragedy and happened so quickly. She&#39;s broken in two. There&#39;s no time to be of any help. In the distance below, I spot the flames begin to spread. Plumes of sludge and smoke fall to the surface. I hope that everyone got free. The interceptor turns back, but I&#39;m already beyond their range. They give up. Now, it&#39;s only me.</p>\n\n<p>I thought I might be caught in the city, but I&#39;m sure that now, I&#39;ve got a clear shot to Nora. My ship dips, <em>Opportune</em> has been working hard all morning. The engine&#39;s hum fills my head, and I hear static on the comm. I&#39;m tired, but I&#39;ll have all of the time I need, soon. I glance back again. The guard is out of view. &quot;We did it.&quot; I whisper to <em>Opportune</em>. She turns again, her engines working hard to get us through the wind.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t look back.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The alpine city of Kethar is roughly the same size as the one I&#39;ve left. It lies a 1,400km due north, high in the Kelesian mountains. It&#39;s a city along a wide river nestled in a well-protected valley. It was settled as a center for the patchwork of mining, farming, and timber operations in the region. Its destiny was to become much more. </p>\n\n<p>Kethar is the site of the most decisive events of the war, the battle of Holly Pass. The revolution and the war had been dragging on for three lya. During an earlier campaign, the empire attempted an air assault but failed. The cities air defenses proved formidable. It was a major stronghold for the Kelesian confederate forces. The king&#39;s army, spread thin from fighting on six other worlds, was forced to make landfall far outside the cities defenses. They were untrained and ill-prepared. </p>\n\n<p>The Kelesians fortified their defenses around the rugged pass as the empire deployed long-range artillery. Though the months of bombardment, the city stayed the course. However, the empire was powerless against the Kelesian air-based counter-attacking. The coyotes owned the sky. Winter began, and the Kelesian air calvary stopped targeting artillery and equipment. Instead, they focused their air-superiority on imperial supply lines. The calvary decimated fuel, food, clothing, and medical supplies. The counter bombardments became less frequent, the imperial lines wained and wavered. A lack of supplies combined with the outlook of another unbearable winter forced the imperial army to retreat and the delegation to begin negations in Carit.</p>\n\n<p>During the war, the colonies may have had a common goal, but they were physically scattered throughout the galaxy. If there had to have been a single place that was the home of the revolution, it was Kethar. And the mountains surrounding that home provided shelter from the orbital bombardment that followed the retreat of the Imperial ground forces. The Kelesians had been hollowing out the caves and cliffs around Kethar since before the war began. Because of this, many lives were saved during the orbital bombardment. The war may have been lost in the end, but many doubt it ever ended for these people.</p>\n\n<p>If there was going to be a new center for another revolution, this would be it. It had to be.</p>\n\n<p>I look through the windows of <em>Opportune</em> over the treetops and blue green lakes and wonder how Malik got involved. How he got <em>me</em> involved. How his words have always been profound, if not slurred from a night of drinking Zalara. I&#39;ve always known him as the owner of a grungy bar on a dilapidated free port, while his past has always been swirling in mystery. Before we met, he was a merchant in this system. He&#39;d tell me tales of run-ins with revolutionist politicians, or the ace pilot&#39;s he&#39;d race through the Troxell nebula. I thought they were stories, and just that. Never did I think he&#39;d actually become involved.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, here I am.</p>\n\n<p>Almost on cue, I&#39;m intercepted by two small fighter craft, different from the one when I left the starport. This isn&#39;t the empire. They&#39;re armed, but don&#39;t make radio contact. They flank me, forcing me to slow and loose altitude as a small grey airfield emerges in the tree-line. One of the interceptors takes the lead and I follow them down. Closer to the trees now I can see various buildings, fuel tanks, hangers, a fairly elaborate military operation seems to be underway right in front of me. It strikes me that it is also right under the nose of the empire.</p>\n\n<p>The airfield appears to be in full swing. There&#39;s various craft coming and going, ships being refueled and maintained. I bring us down for a landing, and on the pad are people dressed like those I saw on Bowenn. A uniformed man guides me down by waving illuminated batons, while a troop of armed guards approach my ship from the front. <em>Opportune</em> settles on the pad and I shut her down. The quiet is unsettling given the amount of activity&nbsp;I see taking place through the forward windows.</p>\n\n<p>Before leaving my ship, I make sure to get everything I need. <em>Reason to Believe</em> joins me at my waist.</p>\n\n<p>When the aft door opens, I meet my new friends with hands raised.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is your business here?&quot; Is the first thing I hear once the ramp of my ship reaches the tarmac. While the first thing I see is a group of armed soldiers waiting for that explanation.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I am no enemy of yours. I have been sent by Kadina.&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>I hear the clinking of their weapons as they are slightly lowered. The name bears weight and the soldiers loosen their grips. From the ranks, A burly, bearded man approaches. He&#39;s clearly Kelesian, sturdy and warm. &quot;Well. You should have said so.&quot; He says moving to the front of his men. &quot;Weathers.&quot; His burly voice bellows as he sticks his thick hand out towards me. </p>\n\n<p>We shake. &quot;Stand down.&quot; He tells the group of soldiers and they slowly disband, slinging their weapons. &quot;Kadina arrived this morning. She spoke of you. We&#39;re glad to have your company.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is this place?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We call it The Forge.&quot; His response comes as two aircraft buzz the trees, ripping and roaring. </p>\n\n<p>I look in the sky for the third Kelesian sun. A dim, yellowish point of light hangs low in the branches of the trees. The Tu might have made it here by now.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And the Tu? Have they arrived as well?&quot; I ask as a small craft begins to power up behind us. The airfield has momentary paused for my arrival, but is now beginning to come back to life.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Come. There is much to discuss.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He takes me by the shoulder, and we begin towards a group of buildings near the edge of the pad. Beyond the low structures is a dense forest, thick with old pine trees, and green mountain cliff rising into the hazy sky.</p>\n\n<p>We walk for a moment and he continues &quot;This is our headquarters - at least, for now.&quot; Boyce&#39;s hand slaps my shoulder like a friendly punch. &quot;Welcome.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As I walk closer to the building, I can hear the rumble of engines and shouts from the assembled workers. Trees are being cut down and placed on a large conveyor belt that moves towards the chipped mountain wall. On its other end are two massive cranes and a flat plateau-like space with structures being built with surprising speed. This is not a war front, but a supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We are constructing a forward operating base here, just in case.&quot; Boyce waves his hand as we enter a double doorway in a nearby&nbsp;gated area. &quot;And this place has already proven its defensive capabilities in the last war. We hope to never have to use it again, but it&#39;s comforting to know we will have the advantage.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How many soldiers?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;A small number.&quot; He smiles. &quot;But there is much to do. The Forge is on high alert, and we need to keep our supply lines open. Our brothers and sisters are helping where they can. Although they do occasionally pick fights with the empire.&quot; He laughs.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They&#39;re very brave.&quot; I manage a smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; He opens a door on our left. &quot;Here.&quot; He says through his beard. &quot;This will do for now. The people of this valley have been good to us here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nod, and he waves to a guard standing in front of a dark colored door.</p>\n\n<p>The smell of brewed tea and old floor coverings reminds me of the house in Lilia Hollow. I overhear a conversation that&#39;s already taking place.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And you are certain of this?&quot; Kadina is looking into the vulpine eyes of a Drenth from across the room, but glances at me to take a seat.</p>\n\n<p>It appears as though tea has been already been served. Yellow, dappled light pours through a narrow window high on the far wall. Three Drenth occupy low, plush seating on the far side of the room, and Kadina is upright on an old couch. She&#39;s looking hard at the creatures. They are identical to that of the reef dwellers: triangular ears, upturned and pointed snout. But their lineage is vastly different. The reef dwellers were cut off long ago from the Drenth republic and lacked the grace and poise of these beings.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, they speak fluent Athylian and are accustomed to the modern cultural practices of the Drenth. These three seem to be wearing formal clothes, not a military dress. They appear to me as officials — Drenth intelligence officers.</p>\n\n<p>To the left of Kadina, Weathers takes a seat, and nearby me are two younger lower-ranking members of the Forge listening and standing watch. They are runners, responsible for carrying messages to and from command posts in the region. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, I assure you. Our source <em>can</em> be trusted.&quot; The smallish creature says with a voice too deep for the size of its body. It&#39;s pointed ears are tipped with white, and its muzzle greyed, the sign of an old Drenth. These markings come with wisdom and age. The elder is flanked by two younger-looking creatures, both furred in tan and white. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Need I remind you of Port Charity?&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>The room pauses for a moment, apparently reminded. &quot;Very well,&quot; Kadina says as she stands. &quot;We owe you a great debt.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Weathers stands as well as the Drenth exit. They nod at me on the way out of the small room. In the hall, they&#39;re directed out by a Forge soldier. Presumably back to their ship and back to their vast republic beyond the scoret coast.</p>\n\n<p>Kadina sits back on the couch. It&#39;s been a long day for her, and it&#39;s about to get longer.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The General must know about this.&quot; She says aloud, scribbling on a page.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He&#39;s off planet.&quot; Weathers reminds. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I know.&quot; She says, then turns to the two soldiers in the room. &quot;Corporal. Send word to General Resnick. Make haste.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The sound of his name perks my ears, and I&#39;m reminded why I&#39;m here. She folds the note and hands it to one of the message runners.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; The young soldiers make a quick exit, and she turns to me. &quot;Amal. We need your help now, more than ever.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course. I am here to serve.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re quite eager are you not?&quot; She asks. Maybe she didn&#39;t see through my lie, but I couldn&#39;t help but feel skepticism in her voice. &quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; She continues, &quot;This situation requires urgency as well as a delicate hand.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nod, listening.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What I&#39;m about to tell you needs to be handled with the utmost secrecy. We&#39;ve received information from our spies within the imperial command that a plot to kill or capture General Resnick is underway.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I swallow my guilt and hide my fear.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Just before you arrived, our Drenth contacts confirmed an imperial fleet departing Cevos orbit early this morning. We believe the fleet intends to intercept the general&#39;s convoy during his return to Kelesia.&quot; She pauses. &quot;Tonight. I&#39;ve dispatched our couriers to give the word not to board the transport. I hope it&#39;s not too late. &quot;She pauses again and looks through the window at the third sunset. &quot;If our couriers are successful, then we&#39;ll need someone who can get Resnick out without the empire knowing,&quot; She says. &quot;Can you do this Amal?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Without a doubt.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She pauses, looking quite hard at me. I&#39;m not sure if she is testing my loyalty or wondering if I&#39;m reliable. I need to get to Resnick. I want to change my answer. Instead, I hold her gaze and quell the thumping of my heart.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So be it.&quot; She says. &quot;You shall rendezvous with the general&#39;s convoy in the Yidios system. A moon there called Isle of Antenor.&quot; She addresses me like she is explaining the working of a gear box. &quot;We will need to get your papers in order. You may have to travel through imperial checkpoints.&quot; Concerned, she turns to Weathers. &quot;Prepare a transport ship.&quot; He obeys and departs the room.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What about my ship?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The empire has a keen eye out for smugglers. It could be recognized. We can&#39;t take that chance.&quot; She says.</p>\n\n<p>I think for a moment. If I was going to take the General back to Port Bethany instead of here, I&#39;d have to do it in my ship. I&#39;m not leaving <em>Opportune</em> here. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;She&#39;s a blockade runner. Fast enough to outrun them even if I am spotted. She can get the job done, Kadina.&quot; I said, nodding.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When they realize the General is not aboard his convoy, empire will have every single ship in the region on high alert.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Trust me, I know how to get out of tight corners.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She thinks for a moment, looking at me, contemplating her move. &quot;Very well.&quot; She turns to the two new runners in the room. &quot;Tell Quartermaster Sergeant Weathers to get Captain Amal&#39;s ship ready instead. It&#39;s the... old one.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I smile.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Orbital space above and around the moon is a restricted military zone. You will need to avoid patrols and travel in complete darkness.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ll make it work,&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>We pause for a moment. I motion for the door.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re fugitives now, Amal, hiding on borrowed time.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask standing in the door way.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The empire&#39;s web is thick. It&#39;s only a matter of time before they find us. I&#39;ve accepted this. Our lives have changed for good now.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I nod. &quot;In that case, let&#39;s be about it. I&#39;d hate for the general to arrive late to the party.&quot;</p>\n\n<h1>17</h1>\n\n<p>In my ship&#39;s cockpit, I look over the counterfeit documents the so-called &quot;Forge&quot; group provided me. Two Imperial identification records, one for the general, a shipping manifest, and an authorization pass, comprised the packet. These documents should allow passage through highly controlled imperial space to the Isle of Antenor.</p>\n\n<p>The documents themselves are printed on small cream-colored sheets bearing a stamp, seal, and signature of the Athylian minister of trade. Although he has no idea, he authorized these. </p>\n\n<p>My new name is Jane Birchett. Could it possibly sound any more Athylian? I&#39;m supposed to be from Seralia City on New Athylia. Never heard of it. At least my photo looks like me, even though I tried to look as much as a proud, law-abiding Athylian as possible. Plain, hair tied back, not smiling. Quite imperial. I hope it is good enough—only one way to find out.</p>\n\n<p>I look at Resnick&#39;s forged identity. I see the photo of a bony, older man. He&#39;s clean-shaven with brown eyes. This picture doesn&#39;t make him look like the man of stone he&#39;s made out be. Instead, his frailty stands out more than anything. &quot;George Dempsey&quot; I read the name he&#39;d be traveling under aloud. A machinist from Kelisia.</p>\n\n<p>Next, looking at the forged shipping manifest looks like I&#39;m hauling a load of food supplies under contract with a corporation from that same city on Lepus. Couple pallets of fresh produce, bulk juice, and a handful of crates of vegetables and grain. All bound from Tallonite to Antenor.</p>\n\n<p>Tallonite, I <em>have</em> been to. It&#39;s an agricultural world. Sweltering and dry during the summer and cool and damp in winter when frequent ground fog is known regionally as &quot;moon haze,&quot; which covers the land occasionally. Tallonite is known for its bountiful fruit crop and the extensive irrigation infrastructure used to cultivate them. </p>\n\n<p>Over the last decade, Tallonite has turned into one of the major producers of food in the sector, and I hear that the sector governor has been quite friendly to the corporations operating there.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Kadina&#39;s organization is up to no good, they sure know a lot about the shipping routes and infrastructure and the sector&#39;s situation. This is an impressive forgery. They&#39;ve been doing this for some time, right under the eyes of the Empire.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder what I am going to find on the Isle of Antenor. I wonder why Resnick is there and what he is planning. Am I being set up? I will let my senses do the talking. If he tries something, I won&#39;t hesitate to fight. He&#39;s coming with me to Port Bethany one way or another.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve also taken some steps to complete the ruse by disguising my ship. The transponder codes are legal and registered replacements. The ship also gets a new name: <em>Agrarian Rose</em>, a private trader certified by the Athylian Empire to carry non-military cargo. They&#39;ve also painted her with a symbol that resembles that of the food corporations operating out of Tallonite. All she needs now is a cargo.</p>\n\n<p>As I&#39;m going through my ship&#39;s start-up, now known as <em>Agrarian Rose</em>, the loaders are hastily placing crates in my cargo hold. It&#39;s some local food. It does not match the manifest, but you wouldn&#39;t know by the look of the stuff. Stacks of crates are placed in the hold. They look authentic. They even smell authentic. This might be crazy enough to work.</p>\n\n<p>I glance out the window of my ship. The suns are low. They are setting over the rooftops and trees of this valley that conceals the Forge&#39;s Operations. A few cargo freighters are docked here, already packed with supplies. They&#39;re unattended, though. The focus seems to be getting me and my ship on our way.</p>\n\n<p>The loaders leave my ship as the last bit of light disappears over the mountains ahead. Under the vivid purple sunset, a few men with glowing orange lights guide the final loaders away. Their taillights fade in the distance. It&#39;s quiet, and my ship is ready. Her engines are warm and idling.</p>\n\n<p>Over the comm, I hear the authorization to depart. There are never any farewells. It&#39;s time to leave Kelisia behind in the fading twilight. It&#39;s time to meet the rebel general on the isle of Antenor and bring him to Ayers. It’s time to finish this.</p>\n\n<p>The engines come to life, and my ship&#39;s thrusters push her up and off the landing pad. Takeoff is a blustery, dusty affair as it always is with gypsy class freighters. As we ascend into the sky, I see the last of the loaders clear the area with its lights.</p>\n\n<p>I feel the increased vibrations and excess thrust in the cockpit as the engines blaze into full operation. Hiking up my seat, I peer outside through the canopy to see the mighty mountain range sprawling out before me. It is a dark silhouette of ridges and peaks against the black of the night sky.</p>\n\n<p>We hover for a moment above the western horizon of Kelisia before leaping over the soaring sunset clouds. I accelerate and adjust my heading for a low orbit. I let out a deep breath as the ship passes a few thousand meters above the cool dark Kelesian ground and below me wheels the coastal mountains and vast swaths of timber and forest. With a smirk, I take in the view of Hethria Bay, a major naval base and mercantile hub for the Athylian Empire.</p>\n\n<p>We fly higher. The bay below disappears into the coastline, then into the ocean. The cities blur into distant patches of yellow light, kissing the grey of the sea.</p>\n\n<p>I hear over the comm an exchange in the imperial standard. It sounds like a battlegroup or carrier is in the system. I go over my false identity again in my head. Fruit. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hauling—just fruit. I can do that.</p>\n\n<p>With a bit of space under her and the suns now just a memory, my ship flies due west towards the stars. A few minutes later, I am a speck, distantly headed towards the vast expanse of stars ahead.</p>\n\n<p>The stars come to life, dancing on the inky black stage of deep space. I plot a course for Antenor. After referring to the navigation charts, I decided against a direct route. Instead, we&#39;ll take Alabaster Pass. A somewhat obscure space lane through the narrow belt of space between Talisman Point and Howell&#39;s Lantern. This should avoid as much imperial nonsense as possible while making it look like we aren&#39;t trying to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>A few minutes into low orbit, we&#39;re in the blackest part of the Kelisian night, soaring over a vast ocean that covers almost three-quarters of the planet&#39;s surface. The third Sun, the smallest of the three, just a speck of light cold bluish light, rises in the starboard horizon. A blue-white curve crests the disc. Clouds swept aside the sun blazes over the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>Under the dim light of the navigator&#39;s station, I calculate the route to take just under four hours. Longer than the direct way, of course. Hopefully, the delay is worth it. I make sure I have the cargo manifest and the sector clearances in order.</p>\n\n<p>I break orbit in the darkness high above the ocean of Kelisia. I hear the whirring of the superluminal drive spooling up. In under a minute, it&#39;s fully charged. I punch it.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the purest, simple sensation. The stars appear to curve all around. I feel an eerie sense of stillness as if time itself has come to a halt. We slip out of regular physics, falling through the cracks in the laws of nature and into the fantastic netherworld of superluminal travel. The boundary between the infinite future and the past dawns around me. It&#39;s a feeling that only those that break the light barrier can genuinely understand.</p>\n\n<p>The profoundness of the occasion, for me at least, has become mundane. I&#39;ve jumped hundreds of times. I take a moment to stretch my body and get ready for a long shift as my ship hurtles through the endless vacuum of space.</p>\n\n<p>Routine is vital in times like these. Unclasping the restraints allows me to walk freely about the ship. I head to the galley. &quot;Ah.&quot; I found the tin of Loreos tea I was looking for. My tea ritual begins. I know this procedure well.</p>\n\n<p>The kettle whistled. I added the loose leaves, dawdled myself into a chair, and set the cup down on the table. My hands placed the lid on the top of the cup with the air of practice. It fit with a satisfying clink, and my hands went to the table, the chair, and my cup.</p>\n\n<p>I let out a sigh, taking a slurp from the small cup. It was smooth and flavorful, as good as I remembered, and as I imagined it would be. I stirred the Buresh then brought the cup to my lips again, savoring the taste.</p>\n\n<p>I think back to my time aboard the <em>Normandie Place</em>, missing being part of a crew, missing having other people around. Jin was funny. Olen was peculiar. Sev was an inspiration. And Dusty, well, I&#39;ve yet to meet anyone like him elsewhere. I wonder if they&#39;d ever guess how much I&#39;ve missed them all. I&#39;d never found a crew like that again, or at least I&#39;d never had the chance.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Rested, I got myself in order before what was sure to be a long night. I finished off the last of some food in the galley. We were coming up on the rimward mouth of Alabaster Pass. The outlet of this route will deposit my ship and me in front of the planet Yidios.</p>\n\n<p>It strikes me that general Resnick must have very much wanted to visit Antenor. It lies on an important trade route and is subject to quite a bit of imperial interest. I wonder how many times he&#39;s made this journey and why. I suppose I&#39;ll find out soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>I take a seat and ready myself for coming out of faster-than-light travel. With my foot, I lock the leather command chair into the forward position. A familiar audible tone sounds as the dynos begin winding down—my ship rattles. I tighten the restraints.</p>\n\n<p>We hurtle out of timelessness and into the physical realm, and smash through the vale. I could tell this would be a rough one. The ship shudders and shakes violently. I grab the controls and try and regain some semblance of control. A brilliant flash of light and we stagger into the star system Yidios, flying sideways. The controls still aren&#39;t responding. I try again and thrust, but it&#39;s only a sharp wrench to the side. Suddenly, it rights itself. I take a breath and let the momentum pass.</p>\n\n<p>This was going to be an interesting trip.</p>\n\n<p>I bring her about, aiming the bow towards the gas giant planet Yidios, and breathe a sigh of relief. &quot;Well. That could have been worse.&quot; I whisper to myself.</p>\n\n<p>The planet Yidios is beautiful as a swirling painting. Its surface is a whirlpool of oranges, yellows, reds, and pink surrounded by a wide, colorful ring. It&#39;s hard to tell there&#39;s a small rocky moon caught somewhere in its orbit from this distance. It&#39;s a sight worth seeing. The Southern Hemisphere is bathed in a soft orange glow, and its edge almost touches the ring of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>The distance is still a way off, but I carefully bring the ship around, parallel to the planet, tracking its orbit. Out here, they expect me to follow Athylian imperial standard practices. I&#39;ve got to play by the book if this is going to work. I announce my arrival on the local channel, trying to sound formal. Like someone named Jane Birchett would.</p>\n\n<p>I clear my throat and press the transmit switch. &quot;Agrarian Rose, arriving for Antenor at waypoint...&quot; I checked the charts. &quot;WIND.&quot; The transmit button clicked off when I let go.</p>\n\n<p>It was only a moment before imperial customs wanted to be involved.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Agrarian Rose, you are not on our arrivals. Say again your destination.&quot; The voice sounds imperial. I&#39;d been expecting that.</p>\n\n<p>I clear my throat and am patient in response, pretending to be accustomed to having to do so, raising my tone just a bit.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Antenor Docks,&quot; I said slowly. &quot;I&#39;ve got some fruit here.&quot; Oh, if they could only see my face. A chorus of imperial customs comms rings goes off in my ear. &quot;We don&#39;t have anything showing for you here, Agrarian Rose.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Attempting to prop up the ruse, I took a moment to adjust the mic and sit up a little straighter. &quot;There must be a mistake,&quot; I say, letting a bit of indignation creep in. &quot;My cargo was filed.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A moment passes. I can tell they are busy checking things out. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Agrarian Rose, you are non-compliant. Proceed to checkpoint CALIBER, and prepare for inspection.&quot; The voice hissed and buzzed over the long-distance radio connection.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Understood. Rose.&quot; I said.</p>\n\n<p>I had their attention. I was nervous now. My ship banked and made a full burn towards the giant globe and towards the imperial customs flotilla. </p>\n\n<p>I breathed deeply, trying to relax. There were only a few ships—three vessels flying the scarlet flag of Athylia. Smallish ones. Not a battle group. They were out here doing their jobs. I respected that. From what I remembered, it&#39;s rare for them to be together. Perhaps they had reason to be suspicious. I tried not to worry. A few minutes later, I was close enough to sight the CALIBER waypoint buoy.</p>\n\n<p>My ship and I were soon under inspection. The most massive of the imperial cluster deployed a small transport from a hatch on its underside. Its lights blinked as it approached. I watched its silent flight through dark space, growing larger as it came. I could see the silhouette of a crew member in a window on its port side.</p>\n\n<p>They approached me cautiously. The small ship came alongside my own. The transport slowed to a stop, then pulled alongside it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Agrarian Rose, prepare for boarding. Release all docking clamps. Initiate docking protocols.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>They would come aboard, and I would have to play my role. They wouldn&#39;t be able to detect anything that was off. Or would they? I did as instructed and released the docking clamps. The small shuttle moved in and hovered, then docked gently atop my freighter. The airlock made a hissing noise as it groaned open. Per the Athylian imperial standard, the two customs officers walked down from their ship to mine, entering a stairwell behind the bridge.</p>\n\n<p>A uniformed imperial crew member appeared. His posture was strong and confident. Another one followed. They wore plain, white double-breasted imperial coats. Their pants were neatly pressed and crisply starched. I was the one who was dressed the opposite of the Athylian imperial standard. I heard the hatch close behind them.</p>\n\n<p>Life on the frontier taught me to always be expecting weapons. They were both armed with small caliber pistols. They&#39;ve probably never had to use them. Hopefully, today won&#39;t be the day. I locked eyes with them as they approached me. I took up a firm, confident pose myself. Not a defiant stare. I suppose I wasn&#39;t in a position to. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ma&#39;m,&quot; The younger, taller one said. I kept my face straight. &quot;Just a mix-up. We&#39;ll get you on your way.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you, officers,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s good to be back.&quot; I hoped they couldn&#39;t hear the false cheer in my tone.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Your papers?&quot; The older one asked. His thick, lush mustache, well maintained, drew my attention. It covered his lips as he spoke. He was a heavy-set man. I reach for my cargo manifest sitting on the nearby navigation console.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; I said, handing them the forged documents: identification, contract papers, and shipping manifest. I passed the sheet to the younger officer on the right. He waited while the older man reviewed it. </p>\n\n<p>I watched them scan over the first page. The older one with the mustache returned to the top of the list. His face was tense. After what felt like forever, he handed back the papers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very well. Everything seems to be in order.&quot; He said. &quot;Just need to see the cargo hold.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We walked from the bridge into the worn-out cargo area full of crates of Kelesian vegetables and fruits supposed to be from Tallonite. </p>\n\n<p>The older officer moved deep into the bay and used a flashlight to inspect some crates. I stood awkwardly with the younger one near the stair-steps to the bridge. He looked at me. Almost as if he was reluctant to say something. I kept my face straight, my gaze fixed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You&#39;re from Seralia?&quot; He asked, trying to make small talk. I look at him. His eyes are a hazel color. He was about the same height as me, slightly taller. He looks down a moment, letting me know I was aware he was prying.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. I am.&quot; I nodded, my hands clasped behind my back. He nodded, as well.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As am I. A coincidence, is not?&quot; He chuckled. My heart skipped a beat. Coincidence indeed. &quot;What part?&quot; He asked. There was a moment of silence.</p>\n\n<p>I found myself hesitating. I looked at him. We locked eyes again. I opened my mouth to speak, &quot;The–the, by the river.&quot; I stammered. I hoped to the gods there was a river in that damn city.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah. The Filoli river. Yes. Quite a nice area, as I&#39;ve heard.&quot; His voice had a soothing accent. He was being sociable. I smiled, trying to keep my voice strong, &quot;Yes, yes. It is. I miss home.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The older officer set down his flashlight and was fiddling with the lid to a crate. He yelled something in Persid to the one making small talk with me. He checked something on the clipboard and yelled a response in that same language.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sidney.&quot; He said, putting his hand out. &quot;Jane,&quot; I said, shaking it. I hoped he didn&#39;t feel the sweat of my palm.</p>\n\n<p>He had a firm grip. We looked at each other for a second, then I heard a sound and glanced to see the older officer taking a peek inside one of the crates. He hadn&#39;t liked something he saw, I figured.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Did you grew up there?&quot; Sidney asked. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to visit.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>My eyes snapped back to him. He was still looking at me with his sea-green eyes. His messy, shoulder-length brown hair peaked out above his ears. I felt the ship shift beneath my feet. &quot;Pardon?&quot; I asked.</p>\n\n<p>He smiled, nodding as he spoke, &quot;Filoli river. I&#39;ve long wished to see it. My family is from the southern part of the…&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The older officer walked back from the crate, pulling the lid from it. His eyes narrowed, and his mustache twitched. I couldn&#39;t help but be distracted. Speaking into his radio, he spoke something I couldn&#39;t understand. Static and crackles emitted from the device in his hand. He then called out something else and the voices stopped.</p>\n\n<p>He turned toward me. I felt nauseous. He looked at me for another moment, and I at him. It was unnerving. I felt his eyes on me, studying me. He waited for a reply from his radio.</p>\n\n<p>Sidney was still speaking. &quot;… academy. But then, well, I ended up here. Funny how–&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh. It&#39;s uh, yes, it&#39;s quite nice.&quot; I said, cutting him off. He nodded. He could tell I was uncomfortable. I felt I didn&#39;t want anyone to catch me blushing.</p>\n\n<p>A voice came from both their radios. The older officer turned to a different crate and looked at it. Then he looked at me. My breathing was heavy. </p>\n\n<p>The officer called out to Sidney. He went over to the him and looked at the crate, then up at me again. I could feel his eyes on me.</p>\n\n<p>I reached down to make sure my sidearm was with me. If this turned into a gunfight, at least I&#39;d have a chance.</p>\n\n<p>Sidney returned to me after a moment. I searched his eyes for something, looking for some sort of reassurance. I took a deep breath to steady myself.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Right, then.&quot; The older officer said through his mustache. He put away his radio. &quot;Everything looks to be in order. We&#39;ll be on our way.&quot; He said.</p>\n\n<p>What a relief. I tried to smile, but I was a bag of nerves. &quot;Thank you, officer,&quot; I said, nearly winded. Sidney smiled but didn&#39;t speak. Maybe he could tell I was ill at ease. The older officer headed to the top hatch. Sidney followed, stopping beneath the ladder. He leaned to the side and spoke quietly to me. &quot;Well.&quot; He said, looking at me. I could see him looking at my face. &quot;It was a pleasure, Jane. I apologize for the inconvenience.&quot; He gave me a shy smile, and his eyes lingered on me for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>I smiled back, glancing once at the older officer who had started to climb. Then I made a point of looking at Sidney. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; and I started up the stair-steps.</p>\n\n<p>He gave a nod and took his leave. The transports airlock closed. I was finally alone. I hit a button, and the docking clamps released. I was sweating. My chest was aching. My hands were trembling. I sat at the helm, trying to calm down. Through the window, the visiting craft moved away from my position. Before it was gone, a new voice crackled through my radio.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Agrarian Rose, you are clear for departure.&quot; It came in an imperial accent.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Understood,&quot; I said. I stored the cargo manifests and then began to turn my ship around, heading towards the moon. I slumped into the command chair and sighed heavily, and let my head fall back.</p>\n\n<p>I laughed.</p>\n\n<h1>18</h1>\n\n<p>The Isle of Antenor is a grey, rocky moon pinned to the blackness of space. A sphere. Or, rather, it would be a sphere if it wasn&#39;t for the massive helion quarry gouged deep into its surface. Athylian-owned corporations have altered this place almost beyond recognition. Industrial stations, holding tanks, refineries litter the monochrome landscape, all to sustain a planet-sized helion mining operation. I can&#39;t help but be reminded of my childhood on Tau Ogma. </p>\n\n<p>I fly my ship to the passenger terminals. Gliding over the cratered and stripped landscape to a small terminal building, and find an open bay to land. I put my ship down, descending into the bay shadowed by the high ridge of a natural basin. I shut down the engines and pull myself from the pilot&#39;s chair. I make my way through the corridors and through the door leading to the terminal. </p>\n\n<p>The terminal building is a simple affair made of metal and necessity. Inside, the cool air is thick with soot and dust. This place seems even worse than some other buildings. Though it is kept clean, that does little to hide the industrial nature of it all. There&#39;s still obvious signs of disrepair. Through the halls, a crew of laborers sits on broken chairs, shooting darts at a board. They all look disheveled in various ways. Some look poor. Most look ill.</p>\n\n<p>I walk between them, their broken eyes trailing. I look for a possible contact, trying to be nonchalant.</p>\n\n<p>I approach someone and ask if they can point me in the local transport direction. They look at me, almost with interest, then shake their head. These people do not speak Athylian; instead, it&#39;s a language I&#39;ve never heard before. I ask again, making sure to pronounce everything correctly. They just shake their head again. One of them has a long beard and hollow eyes. What has life here has done to him?</p>\n\n<p>I exit the docking bay halls and wander through the building, passing by various small food stalls, machine shops, and temporary apartments. The place is worn down, it looks uncared for, bleak. However, there is a hint of a more elegant past in the decor of the hallways. Beautiful and elaborate tile work and pillars show the testament to more grand architecture but look used and abused. I walk down a quiet hall. The floors are cracked and worn, and paint crumbles from the walls. Further, I discover steam rising out from behind an open door. I glance inside. Perhaps there is a kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>Two men look up at me from the stove, and they stare at me. I wave my hand at them, and they turn back to their stoves. I&#39;m not certain if they are sending a message that I am not welcome or think I am dangerous. I shake my head.</p>\n\n<p>I should turn back, I think to myself. Then a voice from behind me startles me. I turn to see an older man in shabby work clothes. I hadn&#39;t even noticed him sitting in a chair along the wall. His head is bald and he has one hand on his knee. He motions at me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You.&quot; He rasps while puffing a hand-rolled cigarette. His voice seems beyond his years. I can&#39;t help but notice the yellow tinge on his skin. &quot;Transports are that way.&quot; He says, pointing to the right. He spoke as my mere presence annoyed him. I look at where he is telling and see a lift with a sign above it that I can&#39;t read. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; I bow my head.</p>\n\n<p>He looks at me and then nods his head at me, and I turn and start towards the lift. I move across the room to the lift and enter it. After a moment, the lift automatically begins its ascent. The elevator stops at the departure level, a hall designated for off-world transport. The elevator opens up to hallway with several signs, clearly pointing towards the transports.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s an expansive, low room with no windows. In the center is are rows of partially filled seating, with several corridors leading to departure gates. The travelers are men who&#39;ve completed their two or three-week shifts on the mine and are eager to depart. They&#39;re tired looking, their eyes blood-shot and heavy with fatigue. They are speaking various languages, hardly any of them Athylian. A man with a faded gray beard behind a counter waves a hand at me. He says something I cannot understand. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I say, unsure if he&#39;s asking me about something or trying to greet me. &quot;Kelisia,&quot; I say. He stares up at me for a moment. His lips curl into a smile as he delivers more indecipherable information. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>I give up. I can&#39;t understand him and no doubt he can&#39;t understand me, so I turn and scan the room. Maybe there&#39;s someone about who can translate. But, I see nobody.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder about the departure level, passing various other workers in the same state as the others I&#39;ve seen in the lower level. From a small stand, a gangling creature with large eyes beckons me to purchase food. Its long fingers point slabs of dried meat, and once I get closer , he holds a large piece showing me it&#39;s texture. The meat is most likely recycled from some sort of lesser creature. I give him a look, to which he mumbles something in his native tongue, something that sounds like hisses and clicks, but he waves in a friendly manner as he invites me to purchase. I shake my head and walk on.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Departures hall. This is where Kadina said I&#39;d find him.&quot; I whispered to myself as I looked about at the expanse of people and creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I notice a tall man standing amid the crowds. He&#39;s a bit out of place here, some, I think some others are glaring at him, looking him up and down. He seems to be looking for someone. I decide to wander closer, trusting that the stranger will not hurt me. I approach him and my heart beat quickens.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Jane?&quot; The man says as I near.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; I almost didn&#39;t respond, due to him using my false name.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Follow me. We don&#39;t have much time.&quot; His voice is stern.</p>\n\n<p>He walks quickly and leads me out of the terminal&#39;s central area down a ramp and into a nondescript loading bay. There I find four transport ships, all being loaded with supplies. Men are working, men who remind me of those I met on Bowenn. Somehow this feels all too familiar.</p>\n\n<p>The tall man takes me near the back of one of the small transport ships. &quot;Wait here,&quot; he whispers.</p>\n\n<p>I stand some distance away from the loading ramp of it, peering in a see a man conferring with his officers, hunched over a makeshift desk cluttered with maps.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;General.&quot; I overhear him say. &quot;She&#39;s here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>General Resnick is a thin man with brown eyes and small glasses. He takes his time standing, a tired shuffling motion. He walks around the desk, passing a few maps to an aide, who places them in the ship&#39;s storage area. As he turns the corner to join me, he looks up, his eyes widening.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Captain Otelia.&quot; He says, using my family name. It&#39;s not often I&#39;m addressed so formally.</p>\n\n<p>I bow my head slightly. &quot;General,&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>He shakes my hand, placing his other hand on my shoulder. He continues to look at me, wondering if I was who he expected. His forehead wrinkles as he studies me. &quot;You look tired.&quot; He said plainly. His voice was gentle.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;You do too,&quot; I reply. Leave it to me, to be honest.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;No rest for the weary, I&#39;m afraid.&quot; We begin walking down the ramp and out of the transport. &quot;We&#39;ve got to move quickly now.&quot; His voice is strong and deliberate.</p>\n\n<p>We walk briskly, but it is an odd sort of brisk that&#39;s entirely opposite of the rest of the crowd. I ask him what he means. &quot;Your convoy intends to leave?&quot; I asked, he must know they&#39;ll be waiting for him in orbit.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; He nods. &quot;We must act as though we know nothing of the forces moving against us. The risk to our spies is too great. Our pilots have been instructed to keep their light drives charged, and at the first sign of danger, they will jump.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;You must know the Athylians will give chase.&quot; I say, stating the obvious.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let them. Our transports will scatter and misdirect them while we make our escape.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s going be close,&quot; I reply.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;More than you know.&quot; He whispers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;By the way, it&#39;s Amal.&quot; I say. &quot;You can call me Amal.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; He says. An officer trots from a transport toward Resnick and I. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; they say, &quot;We&#39;re ready,&quot; The officer seem keen to get things moving. The activity in the landing area has slowed, and the deck hands prepare to board their ships.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Very well.&quot; The General nods. &quot;Good luck. Lieutenant.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>With that, the Lieutenant turns and disappears inside a transport. The remaining crew board the ships, and the hatches and ramps seal shut. We leave the bay as they rattle and whine of their engines, preparing for lift-off. Wide paint-peeled doors open, and the small grey craft take off heading for the jaws of the beast. I&#39;m left alone with the general.</p>\n\n<p>Resnick and I walk back through the corridor to the departure hall. I notice his clothing is plain; he looks as if he&#39;s simply another man waiting for his off-world transport to take him somewhere other than a helion mine. I&#39;m impressed at his composure as if this had all been part of an intricate plan. I wish I could calm my nerves as quickly as he seems to.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Lead the way.&quot; He says, and we begin walking through the station. I feel a sense of unwarranted trust from him. I swallow my guilt and focus on getting him back to Port Bethany, on ending this ordeal.</p>\n\n<p>We arrive at the end of the docking hall. After taking the lift to the lower level we proceed through the station past the rough-looking men and the food stalls and the cheap apartments. The air is foul here like an old rotten rag. It&#39;s a familiar smell. When atmosphere generators are too old, and the scrubbers are too clogged with dust and grime.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, Resnick looks almost irritated. Concerned even, and obviously on edge. He doesn&#39;t speak, but he doesn&#39;t need to. I can read his tension in the way his eyes dart around. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Never been smuggled off-world, I take it, General?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>He is expressionless for a moment but then nods. &quot;First time.&quot; He replies.</p>\n\n<p>We arrive at the docking bay. My ship <em>Opportune</em> stands alone on in a cold empty hanger. I&#39;m reminded of the ruse when I see her new paint scheme. Still the same old ship. Still the same old captain. But I am on a mission. I must and will complete it.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Tallonite Fruit.&quot; He says, reading the side of my ship. &quot;Hm.&quot; He shrugs.</p>\n\n<p>We enter the dark cargo bay of my ship. The smell of fresh fruit wafts into the cold as the ramp closes and the lights come on. I can tell he&#39;s putting the pieces of the plan together. What he doesn&#39;t know of course is what awaits him at our destination. </p>\n\n<p>Resnick and I make our way to the bridge, and I begin the warm-up procedures. He takes a seat in the co-pilot&#39;s chair as I work through the start-up. I try not to look at him too much, but I feel him watching me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Tell me, Amal. How did you come into this unique profession?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s a long story.&quot; I say, checking several readouts, attempting to avoid his eyes. &quot;In that folder are your papers,&quot; I say, pointing to the navigator&#39;s station. &quot;Have a look.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;George.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>I flip a switch on the console, and the metal slats protecting the cockpit glass retract. The landing area is now visible through the cockpit windows. The gravity locks release, and the huge landing bay doors open, revealing the blackness of space and grey ridge of the lunar crater the station is burrowed into.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to the general, I say, &quot;If we run into any trouble, just follow my lead.&quot; He nods. &quot;We&#39;ll travel to Port Bethany, a free port near the boundary zones. It&#39;s far too suspicious for us to go there directly from here. Then you&#39;ll board a passenger star-liner to Kelesia. Your papers should let you board.&quot; I tried to sell the lie with my confidence, but I feel a little uncomfortable about it.</p>\n\n<p>The ship shudders a bit, a vibration I felt through the floor. A kind of vibration I anticipated. She&#39;s ready.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Buckle up.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>We blast out of the hangar bay and into the pitch-dark void of space. I jockey my ship driving her hard to get away from Antenor and the planet as fast as possible, knowing there may very well be an imperial blockade somewhere ahead. A trail of white-hot ions spews from the engines as we race into the darkness. The cracked sphere of a moon slips behind us as we head to slingshot around the planet it orbits.</p>\n\n<p>We need to get a safe distance from the planet&#39;s gravity to engage the superluminal drive. Careless use of these spacetime bending drives has resulted in many captains destroying their engine cores, or in some cases crushing the entire ship into a black hole smaller than a pinhead.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the engine temperature when Resnick calls out, &quot;Look!&quot; He points out of the window at a group of large imperial ships. A carrier battle group. The formation is shifting as if block our path. The blockade .</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Damn.&quot; I whisper. &quot;Just as I suspected. The fleet. They&#39;re going to try and stop all ships.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; Resnick asks as I hear the whine of the FTL dynos charge.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re going through.&quot; I push the engines above maximum. We lunge forward. Our tiny ship started charging the blockade at full speed. The sound of the drive spooling up grows louder and higher pitch.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;All ships must report to checkpoint CALIBER for inspection,&quot; a voice came over the radio and repeated, &quot;Stop, or you will be fired upon.&quot; I turn it off and tighten the restraints on my seat. No sign of the convoy. Maybe they made it out. We were almost at full speed, almost ready to jump.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly to the side of us, a volley of red beams came arcing towards us from the stern. One of the larger ships opened fire with their long guns.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They&#39;re firing!&quot; I cried. The blockade shifted to an attempt to block our path. The huge ships move and change position, showing their broadside. The guns barked us with their power and their accuracy. Explosions broke off behind us. &quot;Damn!&quot; I curse. They&#39;re trying to cripple us, trying to keep us from jumping.</p>\n\n<p>Resnick pulls at his restraints. &quot;Amal, we need to jump.&quot; he says. &quot;Not yet.&quot; I answer.</p>\n\n<p>A second volley comes at us. The red beams carve a path through the bow of our vessel, burning away the plating. The blast wave pushes me back into my seat, and the ship lurches up and out of control. I struggle to regain control — and just as I do, brilliant red beams split space again. We&#39;re rocked back and forth by the blast wave, thrown from side to side. &quot;Dammit!&quot; He yells, gripping his seat. I grab for control, pushing the ship steady despite a heavy resistance. We push forwards, right into the oncoming horde of imperial beams. </p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re closing in. Ever faster. I push the thrusters beyond their limits, trying to make the jump before they can destroy us. There&#39;s a loud groaning vibration that joins the dark whine of the FTL dynos. Smoke swirls through the bridge, and I can smell the sweet scent of burning hydraulic fluid.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re not going to make it!&quot; Resnick yells as the blockade tightens it&#39;s aperture. Our avenues of escape are closing off.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; I yell back and grab the flight controls. I pull back on the stick and the ship shakes. I wince at the screech of the engines as we accelerate through the blockade. We fly through the maze of imperial ships, weaving between them to find a clear path: the ship rolls and dodges like a rat in a maze. We swerve upwards, and there is a terrible grinding noise as our bow catches the bottom edge of one ship&#39;s hull. The ship lurches, and I have trouble keeping control. I push harder on the thrusters, and we dive upwards, away from the ships. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, we&#39;re clear as laser fire showers around us. I hope to the gods we are far enough away from the planet&#39;s gravity to make it as slam on the superluminal drive.</p>\n\n<p>Silence.</p>\n\n<p>In an instant, everything stops. We lose all sensation of movement as we enter superluminal space. To be instantly ripped from physical space into a realm of silent nothingness can be disorienting, surreal to some. I close my eyes and catch my breath. Breathing heavy I sit in the chair while I regain my senses.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We did it,&quot; I whisper, half to myself, half to Resnick. I open my eyes when I smell the hint of burnt circuitry. The power distribution control cabinet is still on fire. Overloaded from one of the blasts from the imperial ships. There&#39;s some smoke in the air, but the fire doesn&#39;t seem to be affecting the ship&#39;s systems.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re not out of the woods yet,&quot; I said, leaping out of my seat to grab the small fire extinguisher. &quot;They&#39;ll be searching every ship.&quot; I say spraying the smoking console with a white foam. &quot;Every ship from here to the end of the galaxy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The foam expands and snuffs out the last embers of the burning hardware before I shut the unit off. I look around the bridge for any more damage. It seems minimal, when satisfied, I toss the used canister to the deck and dust my hands off.</p>\n\n<p>We pause for a moment, still shaking it off, running an imperial blockade, and somehow not dying. As we sit there, I&#39;m suddenly acutely aware of the absence of sound. There&#39;s no rush of air, no hum of the engines, no creaks or groans. No vibration. We&#39;re in the ether. As if giving myself permission to relax, I physically deflate. I feel the adrenaline leaving my body.</p>\n\n<p>I look over at Resnick, and he looks back. There&#39;s a curious look in his eye, like he wants to say something but is at a loss for words. I get the sense he&#39;s not accustomed to traveling on starships.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; I ask him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Amazing.&quot; He says. &quot;We just…&quot; He trails off and shakes his head.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ve got some time before we need to worry. If the gamma winds remain in our favor, we should make it back before the next cycle. A day&#39;s journey at most.&quot; I say.</p>\n\n<p>He nods.</p>\n\n<p>I move to the exit of the bridge and motion for him to follow me. We enter into the narrow passage of my ship that connects the quarters, galley, and the bridge. &quot;You can get some rest. I&#39;ll make us some tea.&quot; Resnick nods and follows me into the galley. I turn on the stove and place the kettle. He sits at the small table, pulls a chair out for me, and puts down his bag. The tea is heating on the stove, and the scent fills the cabin.</p>\n\n<p>The kettle whistles, and I pour water into my old teapot. Sweeping the kettle in circles, I warm the inside. I add the tea leaves and stir, then place the lid and set it on a tray. I put the tray on the table and sit next to him. I hand him a cup.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he says. We sit for a moment, taking in the peace of the cabin and the stillness of faster than light travel. He sips the tea and closes his eyes. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;ve always hated traveling on starships,&quot; He says, &quot;But this makes it better. Tastes like home.&quot; I let him take a moment of silence as I lean against the bulkhead. He sets his cup down. &quot;How about some food?&quot; He asks. </p>\n\n<p>I nod and step towards the table as he reaches for his simple backpack, unlatching the top. He opens it and pulls out a handful of long green stems, a quarter of a loaf of crusty brown bread, and a green jar.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What is that?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Belinda grass.&quot; He tells me. &quot;It&#39;s a sort of meadow grass found on Kelesia. We cook it in a butter sauce with some wild mushrooms. It&#39;s a simple but full of flavor. It will leave you full until your next meal.&quot; He smiles. His glasses have slipped down his nose a little, and he pushes them up on his face.</p>\n\n<p>I smile back, intrigued. &quot;Let&#39;s eat then,&quot; I say, reaching for the jar. He hands it to me and takes a piece of bread, spooning the thick, fragrant sauce over it.</p>\n\n<p>I dig in, hungrily devouring the savory dish. The bread is tender and soaked in the rich, herbal butter, the wild mushrooms plump and dense. The Belinda grass has a flavor that is indescribable, but unforgettable once tasted. Flavors swirl in my mouth, blending together to create a vivid picture of a cool summer night in the northern fields of Kelesia. The flavor is so intense that I close my eyes for a moment, fully immersed in the sensory experience.</p>\n\n<p>I hear the low rumble of Resnick&#39;s voice. &quot;Did you like it?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>When I open my eyes, I see that Resnick is staring at me. I smile sheepishly, feeling a little embarrassed that I was so lost in the moment. He smiles back at me, his glasses slightly slipping down his nose. &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s my grandmother&#39;s recipe.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I finish the last bite and set the jar down on the table, looking at Resnick. It&#39;s strange, because in this moment, he doesn&#39;t seem like the great general that the Athylian Empire fears. He seems like a normal, everyday person, sitting in front of me. He takes another long sip of his tea, his eyes flicking up to the ceiling as he sets the cup down.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My grandmother was a wonderful woman,&quot; he tells me, his voice low and rumbling. &quot;She was kind, but firm. It was difficult to disobey her. I think she would have been disappointed in me.&quot; There&#39;s a sadness in his eyes as he speaks, and for a moment, I think he might cry. But he quickly shakes it off and takes another sip of his tea, breaking the tension. I can&#39;t help but feel a sense of empathy for him, despite the fact that he&#39;s the enemy I&#39;m supposed to bring to Port Bethany for trial. In this moment, he&#39;s just a man, with a complicated past and a complicated present.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I say. &quot;I have to admit, you&#39;re not quite what I expected.&quot; I pause for a moment, trying to juxtapose in my mind the notorious rebel general the empire sent me to capture against the man sitting in my galley talking about his grandmother&#39;s recipes.</p>\n\n<p>He laughs. &quot;Neither are you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot; I find myself returning his smile. </p>\n\n<p>He takes a few more bites before setting his plate down on the table. &quot;What about you? What&#39;s your story?&quot; He asks.</p>\n\n<p>I pause. His invitation to talk about myself leaves me with a realization that no one has asked me that question in a very long time. He sees my hesitation and changes positions slightly, turning towards me. I look up and meet his eyes.</p>\n\n<p>I want to tell him. The truth, that is. But I can&#39;t. So I explain leaving the mines of Tau Ogma as a child. Malik and Bowenn and meeting Kadina. I explain everything. Everything, except he won&#39;t be boarding a star-liner back to Kelesia. Or how the empire will make an example of him at his trial. Or how my freedom is tied to his life.</p>\n\n<p>And he listens patiently, and I continue through to the end. That is when he finally speaks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I know why you&#39;ve come for me, Amal. I know what awaits me at Port Bethany.&quot; He says. My heart sinks. I keep my eye contact and don&#39;t respond. &quot;The king&#39;s men may have their prize, but first, you need to know the truth.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I say weakly. The pit in my stomach grows deeper when I hear the conviction Resnick&#39;s voice. &quot;Spies hide in plain sight. Commander Kadina. She is not who you think she is. She&#39;s a traitor. An agent of the Empire.&quot; My heart is pounding. I watch his face as he prepares to speak.</p>\n\n<p>He turns his gaze towards me and leans forward. &quot;I am not the enemy,&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>I stop breathing.</p>\n\n<p>I stare at him, speechless. The Commander is a traitor? She is a spy? My mind is reeling. I don&#39;t know what to believe, but Resnick doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s lying. I&#39;ve known him for only moments, and yet I trust him.</p>\n\n<p>Resnick sits back in his seat. He seems calm, but his eyes betray his fear. He&#39;s worried. Worried about his life, his future, the Empire&#39;s retribution, all of it. I drop my head, nowhere to look but towards the floor. My mind races back to Lilia House, the boys, and the Tu. It can&#39;t be. I can&#39;t believe this. She is not an agent of the Empire. No, I cannot believe it.</p>\n\n<p>I look at him. &quot;No–Impossible. I was there, with her and the Tu. They pledged to fight the Empire!&quot; I reply. I feel my face constrict, and I can feel my breath quickening. &quot;You&#39;re lying!&quot; I cry at him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I wish I was.&quot; Resnick says, &quot;But I assure you, I am not. Those Tu, they boarded an <em>off-world</em> transport. The lucky ones will land in a labor camp, others...&quot; He shrugs. &quot;The mines maybe, the weak ones... Amal, we&#39;ve seen it. Where they put the bodies.&quot; He says. &quot;They treat them like animals. The strong ones are put to work, and the rest...&quot; He pauses. There are tears in my eyes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Oh, gods,&quot; I whisper. I can feel my breath creeping into my chest. &quot;Why?&quot; He can see how upset I am. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not breathing. I&#39;m not blinking. Tears are welling in my eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t believe you.&quot; The words choke from my mouth.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Why would I risk so much to just lie to you?&quot; His voice is solemn. &quot;This is why they must be stopped. Taking me to them will only make them stronger. Their grip will only tighten. You must understand.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I suddenly felt used, exploited by Ayers to get to Resnick, deceived by Kadina. My mind turns to vengeance, and I fill with anger.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Who else knows?&quot; I ask. He pauses for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Only the closest of my staff.&quot; He says, &quot;Captain Merrill, Captain Calvin, Lieutenant Shannon. They all know.&quot; I nod. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s not just me he&#39;s bearing this secret alone.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure what to believe anymore.&quot; I say with a sigh.</p>\n\n<p>He looks at me. &quot;I understand.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How long has she been...&quot; I ask, afraid to finish the sentence.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Two, maybe three, lya. A long time,&quot; Resnick says. He sits back in his seat. &quot;She&#39;s their most trusted spy.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;And you&#39;re sure of this?&quot; I ask.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Yes. We, too, have spies.&quot; His voice is stern. &quot;I speak the truth.&quot; He says. He eyes me as I consider his words. My world is crashing down around me. I think about the Tu and the Athylian Empire&#39;s cruelty. I try to remember the day I met Kadina at Lilia House. She seemed so kind. Was it all an act?</p>\n\n<p>I put my head in my hands on the table. I want answers, to know the truth. &quot;She&#39;s going to pay.&quot; I declare, my voice emerging quietly from my hands. Anger boils in me.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t doubt that for a moment.&quot; He says.</p>\n\n<p>I was naive. I’d been playing the empire&#39;s game all this time. The last few cycles make sense now. Ayers, the letter. Everything. I must have seemed a perfect fit. I shake my head as I slowly rise to my feet.</p>\n\n<p>His eyes follow me as I move. &quot;We must act as though nothing has changed. If Kadina senses something is wrong, she&#39;ll know she was exposed.&quot; I say, eyes fierce with determination. &quot;And we can&#39;t let that happen.&quot; I pace about the cabin. &quot;I have a plan.&quot; I tell him.</p>\n\n<p>The old general looks at me from his chair. &quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; He asks.</p>\n\n<p>I stop pacing and turn to the General. &quot;We need to find Dusty Hammond.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;…Who the hell is that?&quot;</p>`;\n"]}
